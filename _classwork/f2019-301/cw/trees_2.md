1.  Explain why the Prufer code 01274 is invalid.

2.  Write the Extended Prufer code and draw the corresponding tree:

    1.  01264
    
    2.  02020
    
    3.  54321
    
    4.  7634244
    
    5.  333333
    
3.  Write the Prufer code for the trees on the side whiteboard.
    
4.  Use a random number generator (ex: Google "roll a die") to draw
    a random labeled tree with 10 vertices. Justify why your tree really is
    random.

5.  Show that a graph \\(G\\) is a tree if and only if it contains no cycles,
    but adding any new edge creates a cycle.
