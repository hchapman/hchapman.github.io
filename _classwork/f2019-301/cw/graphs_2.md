1.  Let's show that: If \\(G = (V,E)\\) is disconnected, then \\(\bar G = (V,
    \bar E)\\) is connected. Let \\(a, b\\) be vertices in \\(V\\).
    
    1.  If there is no path between \\(a, b\\) in \\(G\\), explain why there is an
        edge in \\(\bar G\\) connecting \\(a,b\\).
        
    2.  If there is a path between \\(a, b\\) in \\(G\\), explain why there is
        a vertex \\(c \in V\\) for which there is no path to either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\).
        
    3.  If there is a path between \\(a, b\\) in \\(G\\), explain why there is a
        path connecting \\(a\\) to \\(b\\) in \\(\bar G\\).
        
    4.  Conclude that \\(\bar G\\) is connected.

2.  Let \\(G\\) be connected and cycle-free. Say \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices.

    1.  Show that if we add a new edge to \\(G\\) we introduce a cycle.

    2.  Show that if we remove an edge from \\(G\\) we disconnect it.
    
    3.  Show that \\(G\\) has at least \\(n-1\\) edges.
    
    4.  We'll prove later in class that \\(G\\) has **exactly** \\(n-1\\) edges.
        Can you see how you might show that now?
