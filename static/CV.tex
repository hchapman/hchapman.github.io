\section*{Publications}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Asymptotics of knot and link diagrams. In preparation.\\
  \textit{I prove 0-1 laws for tangles in diagrams using techniques
    and results from the study of combinatorial maps.}
\item On probabilistic unknotting algorithms using only local information.\\
  with J.\ Cantarella, E.\ Lybrand. In preparation.\\
  \textit{There is a simple deterministic algorithm for converting any
    knot diagram to a diagram of the unknot by crossing changes, but
    it requires global information about the diagram. Using our
    enumeration of diagrams, we consider whether there is a
    probabilistic algorithm for unknotting a diagram as such with only
    local information. This question is relevant to the untangling of
    DNA by topoisomerase action.}
\item Random Knot Diagrams.\\
  with J.\ Cantarella, M.\ Mastin. In preparation.\\
  \textit{We compute the exact probability that a random diagram of
    $n$ crossings has a given knot type (for $n \leq 10$) by directly
    enumerating and classifying the knot diagrams of $n$
    crossings. Our enumeration method is based on identifying knot
    diagrams with a class of embedded 4-regular planar graphs.}
\item A Group-theoretic Approach to Human Solving Strategies in
  Sudoku.\\
  with M.\ Rupert (Mentor: E.\ Arnold). \textit{Colonial Academic
    Alliance
    Undergraduate Research Journal} (2012) vol 3, article 3.\\
  \textit{Paper produced during an NSF REU at James Madison University
    in 2010. We quantify the data of Sudoku board states by
    considering which numbers} cannot \textit{go in a given cell and
    consider how a typical player's solving strategies are a group
    acting on this set of states.}
\item On orbital varieties of type A. \\
  Advisor: T.\ Pietraho. \textit{Honors thesis}, (2011). Bowdoin
  College.\\
  \textit{Thesis on the Smith conjecture on orbital varieties of
    nilpotent orbits in the Lie group $GL_n$.  Outlines the
    correspondence between Young tableaux and orbital varieties and
    concludes with conditions for which certain shapes of Young
    tableaux will admit orbital varities which are not Smith.}
