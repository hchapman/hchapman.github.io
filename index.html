    <h2 class="content">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a mathematics graduate student at the University
      of Georgia working towards a Ph.D. degree. My research interests
      primarily lie within Topology and Geometry. I am studying under
      the direction of <a href="http://www.jasoncantarella.com">Jason
      Cantarella</a>. Recently I have been studying knots in the
      graph-theoretic view of knot diagrams.</p>

    <p>During the 2012-2013 school
      year, I was supported by the University of Georgia's VIGRE II
      grant. I graduated from Bowdoin College in May of 2011 with a
      B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science, with Honors in Mathematics.</p>

    <h2 class="content">Teaching</h2>
    <p>I'm a Graduate Assistant for the USG MATH1113E Precalculus Emporium.</p>
    <p>In the past, I've been instructor for Calculus for Science and Engineering (Spring 2014), and Precalculus (Fall 2013).</p>

    <h2 class="content">Other Interests</h2>
    <p>I like to cook, but I'm not very good at it. It is often difficult
      to get motivated to cook when so much else is
      happening; <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2464">this
      logic can be tough to beat some times</a>.</p>
    <p>Music is great. So much so that I was webmaster & IT
      guru/liason for my <a href="http://www.wbor.org">undergraduate radio station</a>
      (although I never DJ'ed my own show...). We've
      <a href="http://wuog.org/">seized the airwaves from the UGA
      student radio WUOG</a> a few times now.</p>
    <p>I <em>am all about</em> learning how to get computers to do
      everything for me. I'm afraid though that once everything's
      perfectly automated, I'll have nothing left to do... Sometimes I
      publish my programs. There's more on this in
      the <a href="/projects">projects tab</a>.</p>
