    <h2 class="content">About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently a mathematics graduate student at the University
      of Georgia working towards a Ph.D. degree. My research interests
      primarily lie within Topology and Geometry. I am studying under
      the direction of <a href="http://www.jasoncantarella.com">Jason
      Cantarella</a>. Recently I have been studying knots from the
      map-theoretic view of knot diagrams.</p>

    <p>During the 2012-2013 school year, I was supported by the
      University of Georgia's VIGRE II grant. I graduated from Bowdoin
      College in May of 2011 with a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer
      Science, with Honors in Mathematics.</p>

    <h2 class="content">Teaching</h2>
    <p>During the Fall 2015 semester, I'm teaching Calculus I for Science and Engineering (Math
      2250).</p>
    <p>In the past, I've been instructor for Calculus for Science and
      Engineering (Spring 2014), and Precalculus (Fall 2013, Fall 2015), and a
      Writing Intensive Program teaching assistant for a robotics-based Calculus I
      course (Fall 2015). I've also been a graduate assistant for 1113E, the
      University System of Georgia's online precalculus course (Fall
      2014 &mdash; Spring 2015).</p>

    {% comment %}<h2 class="content">Other Interests</h2>
    <p>I like to cook, but I'm not very good at it. It is often difficult
    to get motivated to cook when so much else is
    happening; <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2464">this
    logic can be tough to beat some times</a>.</p>
    <p>Music is great. So much so that I was webmaster & IT
    guru/liason for my <a href="http://www.wbor.org">undergraduate radio station</a>
    (although I never DJ'ed my own show...). We've
    <a href="http://wuog.org/">seized the airwaves from the UGA
    student radio WUOG</a> a few times now.</p>
    <p>I <em>am all about</em> learning how to get computers to do
    everything for me. I'm afraid though that once everything's
    perfectly automated, I'll have nothing left to do... Sometimes I
    publish my programs. There's more on this in
    the <a href="/projects">projects tab</a>.</p>{% endcomment %}
