# Previous Research

* In the summer of 2010, I took part in an REU where we tried to answer
questions about Sudoku (with M. Rupert, mentor E. Arnold): <a
href="http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/caaurj/vol3/iss1/3/">A
Group-theoretic Approach to Human Solving Strategies in
Sudoku</a>.
* During my senior year at Bowdoin (2010-2011), I wrote an
Honors thesis on orbital varieties in GL(<em>n</em>) and the Smith
conjecture (advisor T. Pietraho): <a

orbital varieties of type A</a>.
