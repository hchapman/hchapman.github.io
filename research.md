## Current Research

{:.lead}
My research interests tend towards the intersection of
combinatorics, topology and geometry, with a primary focus on random
knots. I completed my PhD under the direction of <a

I have shown that alternating knots are exponentially rare
in the set of all knots.

## Previous Research

* In the summer of 2010, I took part in an REU where we tried to answer
questions about Sudoku (with M. Rupert, mentor E. Arnold): <a
href="http://digitalarchive.gsu.edu/caaurj/vol3/iss1/3/">A
Group-theoretic Approach to Human Solving Strategies in
Sudoku</a>.
* During my senior year at Bowdoin (2010-2011), I wrote an
Honors thesis on orbital varieties in GL(<em>n</em>) and the Smith
conjecture (advisor T. Pietraho): <a
href="http://bowdoin.aquabrowser.com/?itemid=|library/m/iii-bowdoin|b28667785">On
orbital varieties of type A</a>.
