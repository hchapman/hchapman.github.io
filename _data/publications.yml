        abstract: 'We study random knotting by considering knot and link diagrams
            as decorated, (rooted) topological maps on spheres and pulling them uniformly
            from among sets of a given number of vertices n, as first established
            in recent work with Cantarella and Mastin. The knot diagram model is an
            exciting new model which captures both the random geometry of space curve
            models of knotting as well as the ease of computing invariants from diagrams.
            We prove that unknot diagrams are asymptotically exponentially rare, an
            analogue of Sumners and Whittington’s landmark result for self-avoiding
            polygons. Our proof uses the same key idea: we first show that knot diagrams
            obey a pattern theorem, which describes their fractal structure. We examine
            how quickly this behavior occurs in practice. As a consequence, almost
            all diagrams are asymmetric, simplifying sampling from this model. We
            conclude with experimental data on knotting in this model. This model
            of random knotting is similar to those studied by Diao et al, and Dunfield
            et al.'

        abstract: We consider a natural model of random knotting—choose a knot diagram
            at random from the finite set of diagrams with n crossings. We tabulate
            diagrams with 10 and fewer crossings and classify the diagrams by knot
            type, allowing us to compute exact probabilities for knots in this model.
            As expected, most diagrams with 10 and fewer crossings are unknots (about
            78\% of the roughly 1.6 billion 10 crossing diagrams). For these crossing
            numbers, the unknot fraction is mostly explained by the prevalence of
            ‘tree-like’ diagrams which are unknots for any assignment of over/under
            information at crossings. The data shows a roughly linear relationship
            between the log of knot type probability and the log of the frequency
            rank of the knot type, analogous to Zipf’s law for word frequency. The
            complete tabulation and all knot frequencies are included as supplementary
            data.
