I can't quite think of anything else to write about, so... Here's some python code:

{% highlight python %}
class NewObject(object):
  def __init__(self):
    print("hello")

A = NewObject()
{% endhighlight %}

Here's some math! $f(x) = 24x$

\[ f(x) = x^2 + 4 \]

$$ g(x) = 2x + 3 $$

The following is a math block:

$$ 5 + 5 $$

But next comes a paragraph with an inline math statement:

Another way to write 10 is $$ 5 + 5 $$.
