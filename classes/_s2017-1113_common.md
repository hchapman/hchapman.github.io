### Resources

+ Homework assignments can be found on
  [WebAssign](http://www.webassign.net).
+ Quiz and Exam grades will appear on our course in [eLC](http://elc.uga.edu).
  There is some other information available there as well.
+ The cheapest place to buy WebAssign access
  is
  [this CENGAGEbrain page](http://services.cengagebrain.com/course/site.html?id=1870824),
  the $48 "Enhanced WebAssign Instant Access for Pre-Calculus & College Algebra,
  Single-Term Courses, 1st Edition" option. This makes WebAssign half the price
  that you might see on the WebAssign website, so I strongly recommend this!
+ Information on free tutoring provided by graduate students weekly, M&ndash;R can be
  found [at the study hall webpage](http://www.math.uga.edu/studyhall).
+ Information on tutoring and extra help options can be
  found [at the department's 1113 webpage](http://www.math.uga.edu/1113).
