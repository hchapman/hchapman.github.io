## Exam 1 Topics

Exam 1 will be on Wednesday, February 14 in our normal classroom. No calculators
or textbooks will be allowed. You are, however, allowed to bring **one
handwritten page of notes (front and back)** of your own creation to reference.

There are [practice problems from a
colleague](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~clayton/teaching/m369s17/exams/exam1practice.pdf)
[with solutions
here](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~clayton/teaching/m369s17/exams/exam1practicesolutions.pdf).
I have also posted a copy of last semester's first exam on Canvas.

In addition to the review problems above, also do review the homework. We've had
homework 1,2,3 so far. I'd also encourage you to take a look at [homeworks 1,2,3
from my previous section](/classes/f2017-369/hw/). There are also solutions to
most odd-numbered problems in the book.

This is not guaranteed to be an absolute list of all
topics covered so far, but I hope it may help you to guide your study.

**Topics**

+   Systems of linear equations
+   Gaussian elimination
+   Row echelon and Reduced row echelon forms
+   Using pivots of (reduced) row echelon matrices to express *solutions* and
    *how many solutions* a system of linear equations has.
+   Row operations and elementary matrices
+   Column vectors in $$\mathbb R^n$$
+   Adding and scaling column vectors
+   Linear transformations: $$L(r\vec u + s\vec v) = rL(\vec u) + sL(\vec v)$$
+   Is a function linear or not?
+   Expressing linear transformations as matrices
+   Matrix multiplication
+   Matrix properties
+   Inverse matrices
