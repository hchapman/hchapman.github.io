## Exam 1 Topics

Exam 1 will be on Wednesday, October 4 in our normal classroom. No calculators
or textbooks will be allowed. You are, however, allowed to bring **one page of
notes (front and back)** of your own creation to reference.

In addition to the review problems listed below, also do review the homework.
This is not guaranteed to be an absolute list of all topics covered so far, but
I hope it may help you to guide your study.

+   **Chapter 2**:
    +   Systems of linear equations
    +   Gaussian elimination
    +   Row echelon and Reduced row echelon forms
    +   Using pivots of (reduced) row echelon matrices to express *solutions*
        and *how many solutions* a system of linear equations has.
    +   Row operations and elementary matrices
    +   **Some extra review problems**: 2.2.5, 2.2.9, 2.6.1, 2.6.4
    
+   **Chapter 4**:
    +   Euclidean vector spaces $$\mathbb R^n$$
    +   Column vectors in $$\mathbb R^n$$
    +   Adding and scaling column vectors
    +   Lines, planes, hyperplanes
    +   Euclidean magnitude (length/distance)
    +   Dot products and angles between vectors
    +   **Some extra review problems**: 4.5.2, 4.5.5, 4.5.10

    +   **Some extra review problems**: 5.3.1, 5.3.2a, 5.3.6

+   **Chapter 6**:
    +   Linear transformations: $$L(r\vec u + s\vec v) = sL(\vec u) + rL(\vec v)$$
    +   Is a function linear or not?
    +   Expressing linear transformations as matrices
