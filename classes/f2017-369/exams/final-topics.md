## Final Exam Topics

No calculators or textbooks will be allowed. You are, however, allowed to bring

The following is a (condensed) list of topics which we've covered over the semester.

+   **Chapter 2**:
    +   Systems of linear equations
    +   Gaussian elimination
    +   Using pivots of (reduced) row echelon matrices to express *solutions*

    +   Euclidean vector spaces $$\mathbb R^n$$
    +   Euclidean magnitude (length/distance)
    +   Dot products and angles between vectors

+   **Chapter 5**:
    +   Vector spaces and the ten *vector space axioms*
    +   Examples and counterexamples
