## Exam 2 Topics

Exam 2 will be on Wednesday, November 1 in our normal classroom. No calculators
or textbooks will be allowed. You are, however, allowed to bring **one page of
notes (front and back)** of your own creation to reference.

In addition to the topics below review the homework, specifically assignments 6, 7, 8, and 9.
This is not guaranteed to be an absolute list of all topics covered so far, but
I hope it may help you to guide your study.

You may find questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 on the [practice exam
here](http://www.math.colostate.edu/~clayton/teaching/m369s17/exams/exam2practice.pdf)
([solutions
