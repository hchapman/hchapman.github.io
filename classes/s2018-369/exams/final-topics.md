## Final Exam Topics

Our final exam will be on Thursday, May 10 from 4:10pm--6:10pm in our normal
classroom. No calculators or textbooks will be allowed. You are, however,
allowed to bring **one handwritten page of notes (front and back)** of your own
creation to reference (if you have any questions or concerns about what is
allowed on this sheet, please send me an email).
