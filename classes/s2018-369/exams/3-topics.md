## Exam 3 Topics

Exam 3 will be on Wednesday, April 25 in our normal classroom. No calculators or
textbooks will be allowed. You are, however, allowed to bring **one handwritten
page of notes (front and back)** of your own creation to reference (if you have
any questions or concerns about what is allowed on this sheet, please send me an
email).

In addition to the review problems above, also do review the homework. We've had
homework 7,8,9 so far. I'd also encourage you to take a look at [the homework
from my previous section](/classes/f2017-369/hw/). There are also solutions to
most odd-numbered problems in the book.

This is not guaranteed to be an absolute list of all
topics covered so far, but I hope it may help you to guide your study.
