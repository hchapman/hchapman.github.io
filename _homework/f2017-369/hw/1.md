1. 
    1.  Find all solutions of the system of linear equations

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        3x + 5y &= 3 \\
        5x - 6y &= 0
        \end{aligned}
        $$
       
    2.  On a single coordinate plane, sketch a line for each linear equation in
        the above system, then point out in your graph where your solution from
        part (a) is.

2.  Find *all* solutions of the system of linear equations

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    5x_1 + x_2 &= -3 \\
    10x_1 + 2x_2 &= -6
    \end{aligned}
    $$

3. 
    Write down a system of linear equations that has **no** solutions.

4.  Write down an augmented matrix corresponding to the system of linear
    equations,
        
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    4a + c - d &= 9 \\
    2b + c + d &= 3 \\
    a + b + c + d &= -1 \\
    4b &= 8
    \end{aligned}
    $$
