1. 
    1.  Find all solutions of the system of linear equations

        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        3x + 5y &= 3 \\
        5x - 6y &= 0
        \end{aligned}
        $$

        > Solving the first equation for $$x$$ yields,
        >
        > $$
        > x = \frac{3-5y}{3}.
        > $$
        >
        > Once we plug this in for $$x$$ in the second equation and solve for
        > $$y$$, we get that,

        > $$
        > \begin{aligned}
        > 5x - 6y &= 0 \\
        > 5\left(\frac{3-5y}{3}\right) - 6y &= 0 \\
        > 5(3-5y) &= 18y \\
        > 15 - 25y &= 18y \\
        > 15 &= 43y \\
        > \frac{15}{43} &= y
        > \end{aligned}
        > $$
        >
        > Plugging this $$y$$ into our earlier equation for $$x$$ gives,
        >
        > $$
        > x = \frac{3-5\left(\frac{15}{43}\right)}{3} = \frac{18}{43}
        > $$
       
    2.  On a single coordinate plane, sketch a line for each linear equation in
        the above system, then point out in your graph where your solution from
        part (a) is.

2.  Find *all* solutions of the system of linear equations

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    5x_1 + x_2 &= -3 \\
    10x_1 + 2x_2 &= -6
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > The second equation is twice the first equation, and can be eliminated by
    > an elementary row operation. So, $$x_2$$ is free, and all solutions are
    > described as
    >
    > $$
    > \left( \frac{-3-x_2}{5}, x_2 \right).
    > $$
    >
    > There are other valid ways to write this solution, too.

3. 
    Write down a system of linear equations that has **no** solutions.

    > There are many different solutions here. One example is the system,
    >
    > $$
    > \begin{aligned}
    > x &= 0 \\
    > y &= 0 \\
    > x + y &= 1,
    > \end{aligned}
    > $$
    >
    > Describing three lines that do not have a common intersection point.
    >
    > Another valid solution would be the parallel planes,
    >
    > $$
    > \begin{aligned}
    > x + y + z &= 1 \\
    > x + y + z &= 2.
    > \end{aligned}
    > $$

4.  Write down an augmented matrix corresponding to the system of linear
    equations,
        
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    4a + c - d &= 9 \\
    2b + c + d &= 3 \\
    a + b + c + d &= -1 \\
    4b &= 8
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > This system translates into the augmented matrix,
    >
    > $$
    > \left(
    > \begin{array}{cccc|c}
    >   4 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 9 \\
    >   0 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 3 \\
    >   1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
    >   0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 8
    > \end{array}
    > \right),
    > $$
    >
    > Provided the columns describe (in order) the variables $$a, b, c, d$$.
