1.  Consider the set of vectors in $$\mathbb R^3$$:

    $$
    S = \left\{ 
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}2\\4\\6\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\1\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\4\\5\end{pmatrix}
    \right\}
    $$
    
    1.  Find a vector in $$S$$ which can be expressed as a linear combination of
        the other vectors in $$S$$.
        
    2.  Make a new set of vectors $$T$$ by removing your vector from part (a)
        from $$S$$. Is $$T$$ linearly independent? Explain.
        
    3.  Find a vector in $$T$$ which can be expressed as a linear combination of
        the other vectors in $$T$$.
        
    4.  Make a new set of vectors $$U$$ by removing your vector from part (c)
        from $$T$$. Is $$U$$ linearly independent? Explain.
        
2.  A **unit vector** is a vector whose magnitude is 1.

    1.  Describe all unit vectors $$\vec x$$ in $$\mathbb R^2$$.
    
    2.  For which unit vectors $$\vec x$$ is
    
        $$
        S = \left\{ \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}, \vec x \right\}
        $$
        
        a basis for $$\mathbb R^2$$?
        
3.  
    1.  Find a basis for the vector space of diagonal $$2 \times 2$$ matrices.
    
    2.  An **upper triangular** matrix is a matrix whose entries below diagonal
        entries are all 0. Find a basis for the vector space of upper triangular
        $$2 \times 2$$ matrices.
        
4.  Consider the two bases for $$\mathbb R^2$$;

    $$
    B = \left\{
    \begin{pmatrix}2\\2\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}4\\-1\end{pmatrix}
    \right\} \qquad
    C = \left\{
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}-1\\-1\end{pmatrix}
    \right\}
    $$
    
    1.  Find a matrix $$M$$ that changes column vectors for basis $$B$$ into
        column vectors for basis $$C$$.
        
    2.  Find a matrix $$N$$ that changes column vectors for basis $$C$$ into
        column vectors for basis $$B$$.

5.  Is 5 an eigenvalue of the matrix:

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}1&4\\2&3\end{pmatrix}?
    $$
    
    Explain your answer.
