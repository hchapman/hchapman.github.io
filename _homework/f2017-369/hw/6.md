1.  Using a formula called **Jacobi's formula**, we can deduce that for any square matrix $$A$$,

    $$
    \det(\exp(A)) = e^{\mathop{\rm tr}(A)},
    $$
    
    where $$\exp(A)$$ is the matrix exponential discussed in homework 5. Suppose that a
    matrix $$M$$ is not invertible. Is $$\exp(M)$$ invertible? Explain.
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
        
    > Based on the formula, we know that $$\det(exp(M)) = e^{\mathop{\rm
    > tr}(A)}$$. No matter what $$\mathop{\rm tr}(A)$$ is, $$e^{\mathop{\rm
    > tr}(A)} > 0$$. So $$\det(exp(M)) \ne 0$$, meaning that $$exp(M)$$ is
    > invertible.

 
2.  Suppose $$ad - bc \ne 0$$. Let $$\vec u =
    \begin{pmatrix}a\\c\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$\vec v =
    \begin{pmatrix}b\\d\end{pmatrix}$$.
    
    1.  Can $$\vec v$$ be a multiple of $$\vec u$$? Explain your answer.
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > If $$\vec v = \lambda \vec u$$ for some scalar $$\lambda$$, then $$b =
        > \lambda a$$ and $$d = \lambda c$$. But then $$ad-bc = \lambda ac -
        > \lambda ca = 0$$, which the problem says isn't the case.
    
    2.  Let $$\vec x$$ be a vector in $$\mathbb R^2$$. How many ways are there
        to write $$\vec x$$ as a linear combination of $$\vec u$$ and $$\vec
        v$$? Explain your answer.
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > The number of ways to write $$\vec x$$ as a linear combination of
        > $$\vec u$$ and $$\vec v$$ is the same as the number of solutions to
        > the equation,
        >
        > $$
        > \begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix} \vec y = \vec x.
        > $$
        >
        > Since the determinant of the matrix is not zero (as $$ad-bc \ne 0$$),
        > it is invertible. So, there is only **one** solution $$\vec y$$ and
        > hence exactly **one** way to write $$\vec x$$ as a linear combination
        > of $$\vec u$$ and $$\vec v$$.
 
3.  Let $$B = (\vec e_1, \vec e_2)$$ be the standard basis for the vector space $$\mathbb
    R^2$$. Suppose
    
    $$
    L : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2
    $$
    
    is a linear transformation and that $$L(\vec e_1) =
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$L(\vec e_2) =
    \begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}$$.
    
    1.  Compute the matrix of $$L$$ using the basis $$B$$.
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > The matrix $$L_B = \begin{pmatrix} L(\vec e_1) & L(\vec e_2) \end{pmatrix}$$. Plugging in we get that
        >
        > $$
        > L_B = \begin{pmatrix}1&2\\1&1\end{pmatrix}
        > $$
    
    2.  Compute the trace of your matrix from (a).
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > $$\mathop{\rm tr}(L_B) = 1+1 = 2$$.
    
    3.  If $$ad-bc \ne 0$$, then 
    
        $$
        B' = \left(
        \begin{pmatrix}a\\c\end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix}b\\d\end{pmatrix}\right)
        $$
    
        is a basis for $$\mathbb R^2$$. Compute the matrix of $$L$$ using the basis $$B'$$.
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > The matrix $$L_{B'} = \begin{pmatrix}\vec g& \vec h \end{pmatrix}$$, where $$\vec g$$ is
        > $$L(\vec u)$$ written as a column vector with respect to the ordered
        > basis $$B'$$ and $$\vec h$$ is $$L(\vec v)$$ written as a column
        > vector with respect to $$B'$$.
        >
        > We can use our matrix from (a) to find out a few things. $$L(\vec u) =
        > L_B\vec u$$ and $$L(\vec v) = L_B\vec v$$ (this is what it means to
        > have a matrix for a linear transformation). How does one then write
        > $$L_B\vec u$$ as a column vector with respect to $$B'$$? Remember that
        >
        > $$
        > \begin{pmatrix}s \\ t\end{pmatrix}_{B'} = L_B\vec u
        > $$
        >
        > means that $$s\vec u + t\vec v = L_B\vec u$$. In other words, that means that
        >
        > $$
        > \vec g = \begin{pmatrix}s \\ t\end{pmatrix}
        > $$
        >
        > is the solution to the equation $$A\vec g = L_B\vec u$$, where 
        >
        > $$
        > A = \begin{pmatrix} \vec u & \vec v \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} a&b\\c&d \end{pmatrix}
        > $$
        >
        > Since $$ad-bc \ne 0$$ we know that $$A$$ is invertible, so $$\vec g =
        > A^{-1}L_B\vec u$$. Similarly, $$\vec h = A^{-1}L_B\vec v$$. So,
        >
        > $$
        > L_{B'} = \begin{pmatrix} A^{-1}L_B\vec u & A^{-1}L_B\vec v \end{pmatrix}.
        > $$
        >
        > This answer is fine, as is the answer where each entry is calculated
        > out. But you might also notice that we can write $$L_{B'}$$ a little

        > $$
        > L_{B'} = A^{-1}L_BA.
        > $$
    
    4.  Compute the trace of your matrix from (c).
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > You can use an explicit matrix formula for (c) to find out the answer
        > here. But you can also use properties of trace:
        >
        > $$
        > \mathop{\rm tr}(L_{B'}) = \mathop{\rm tr}(A^{-1}L_BA) = \mathop{\rm tr}((A^{-1}L_B)A) = \mathop{\rm tr}(A(A^{-1}L_B)) = \mathop{\rm tr}(L_B) = 2.
        > $$
    
4.  Find the value of $$a$$ for which

    $$
    \vec v = \begin{pmatrix}6\\a\\-16\\-4\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    is in the set
    
    $$
    H = \mathop{\rm span}\left\{ 
    \begin{pmatrix}-3\\2\\5\\3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\-1\\-2\\-3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\-5\\-2\end{pmatrix}
    \right\}.
    $$

    > Remember that asking if a vector is in a span is the same as asking if it
    > can be written as a linear combination of the spanning vectors. But this
