1.  Using a formula called **Jacobi's formula**, we can deduce that for any square matrix $$A$$,

    $$
    \det(\exp(A)) = e^{\mathop{\rm tr}(A)},
    $$
    
    where $$\exp(A)$$ is the matrix exponential discussed in homework 5. Suppose that a
    matrix $$M$$ is not invertible. Is $$\exp(M)$$ invertible? Explain.
 
2.  Suppose $$ad - bc \ne 0$$. Let $$\vec u =
    \begin{pmatrix}a\\c\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$\vec v =
    \begin{pmatrix}b\\d\end{pmatrix}$$.
    
    1.  Can $$\vec v$$ be a multiple of $$\vec u$$? Explain your answer.
    
    2.  Let $$\vec x$$ be a vector in $$\mathbb R^2$$. How many ways are there
        to write $$\vec x$$ as a linear combination of $$\vec u$$ and $$\vec
        v$$? Explain your answer.
 
3.  Let $$B = (\vec e_1, \vec e_2)$$ be the standard basis for the vector space $$\mathbb
    R^2$$. Suppose
    
    $$
    L : \mathbb R^2 \to \mathbb R^2
    $$
    
    is a linear transformation and that $$L(\vec e_1) =
    \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$$ and $$L(\vec e_2) =
    \begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}$$.
    
    1.  Compute the matrix of $$L$$ using the basis $$B$$.
    
    2.  Compute the trace of your matrix from (a).
    
    3.  If $$ad-bc \ne 0$$, then 
    
        $$
        B' = \left(
        \begin{pmatrix}a\\c\end{pmatrix},
        \begin{pmatrix}b\\d\end{pmatrix}\right)
        $$
    
        is a basis for $$\mathbb R^2$$. Compute the matrix of $$L$$ using the basis $$B'$$.
    
    4.  Compute the trace of your matrix from (c).
    
4.  Find the value of $$a$$ for which

    $$
    \vec v = \begin{pmatrix}6\\a\\-16\\-4\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    is in the set
    
    $$
    H = \mathop{\rm span}\left\{ 
    \begin{pmatrix}-3\\2\\5\\3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\-1\\-2\\-3\end{pmatrix},
    \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\-5\\-2\end{pmatrix}
    \right\}.
    $$
