1.  Find the inverse $$A^{-1}$$ of the matrix $$A$$:

    $$
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 5 & 3 \\ 1 & 0 & 8
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
2.  Let $$\mathbf{0}$$ be the $$2 \times 2$$ matrix with all zero entries.

    1.  Is there a matrix $$A \ne \mathbf 0$$ for which $$AA = \mathbf 0$$? Justify your answer.
    
    2.  Is there a matrix $$B \ne \mathbf 0$$ and $$B \ne I$$ for which $$BB = B$$? Justify your answer.

3.  Find the inverse $$R_\theta^{-1}$$ of the matrix $$R_\theta$$:

    $$
    R_\theta = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos \theta & \sin \theta \\
    -\sin \theta & \cos \theta
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$
