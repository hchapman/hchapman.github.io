1.  Find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors for the matrix

    $$
    A = \begin{pmatrix}
    1&-3&3\\3&-5&3\\6&-6&4
    \end{pmatrix}.
    $$
    
    (*Hint*. One of the eigenvalues is $$-2$$, and you can use polynomial long
    division to factor the characteristic polynomial of $$A$$. You are also
    welcome to use a calculator to find the roots of the characteristic
    polynomial, but all other work must be shown.)

2.  Find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors for the matrix

    $$
    B = \begin{pmatrix}
    9&-8&6&3 \\ 0&-1&0&0 \\ 0&0&3&3 \\ 0&0&0&7
    \end{pmatrix}.
    $$

3.  Find the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors for the matrix

    $$
    C = \begin{pmatrix}
    -1 &1 \\ -1 & -1
    \end{pmatrix}.
    $$
    
    (*Hint*. They may be complex.)

4.  
    1.  Let $$R$$ be a $$2\times2$$ matrix, and $$P_R(\lambda)$$ its
        characteristic polynomial. What is $$P_R(R)$$ (that is, if you plug the
        matrix $$R$$ into all $$\lambda$$s)?
    
    2.  Let $$S$$ be a $$m\times m$$ matrix, and $$P_S(\lambda)$$ its
        characteristic polynomial. What is $$P_S(S)$$? Why does your answer make
        sense?

5.  Two linear transformations, $$L$$ and $$M$$, have the same eigenvalues with
    multiplicities. Additionally, every eigenvector of $$L$$ for eigenvalue
    $$\lambda$$ is **also** an eigenvector of $$M$$ for eigenvalue $$\lambda$$.
    
    Are $$L$$ and $$M$$ the same linear transformation? Explain or give a
    counterexample.
