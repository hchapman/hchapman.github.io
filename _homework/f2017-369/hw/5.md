1.  
    1.  Find the matrix $$\tfrac{d}{dx}$$ acting on the vector space $$V =
        \{a+bx+cx^2 \mid a,b,c \in \mathbb R\}$$ of polynomials of degree $$2$$
        or less in the ordered basis $$B = (x^2, x, 1)$$.
        
    2.  Use your matrix from (a) to rewrite the differential equation ($$p(x)$$
        is a vector in $$V$$)
    
        $$
        \tfrac{d}{dx}p(x) = x
        $$

        as a matrix equation. Find all solutions of the matrix equation, then
        write them as elements of $$V$$.
        
    3.  Find the matrix for $$\tfrac{d}{dx}$$ acting on the same vector space
        $$V$$ but now with the ordered basis $$C = (x^2+x,x^2-x,1)$$.
        
    4.  Use your matrix from (c) to rewrite the differential equation ($$p(x)$$
        is a vector in $$V$$)
    
        $$
        \tfrac{d}{dx}p(x) = x
        $$

        as a matrix equation. Find all solutions of the matrix equation, then
        write them as elements of $$V$$.

2.  Suppose that $$A$$ is a square matrix that is **antisymmetric**, meaning that

    $$
    A = -A^T.
    $$
    
    Prove that $$\mathop{\rm tr}(A) = 0$$.
    
3.  The **matrix exponential** of a matrix $$M$$ is given by the Taylor series,

    $$
    \exp(M) = I + M + \frac 12 M^2 + \frac 1{3!} M^3 + \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{k!}M^k}.
    $$
    
    For $$\lambda \in \mathbb R$$, let $$A$$ be the matrix:
    
    $$
    A = \begin{pmatrix}\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda \end{pmatrix},
    $$
    
    and let $$B$$ be the matrix:
    
    $$
    B = \begin{pmatrix}0 & \lambda \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    1.  Find a concise formula for $$A^k$$, for any integer $$k$$.
    
    2.  Find a concise formula for $$\exp(A)$$.
    
    3.  Find $$B^k$$, for any integer $$k$$.
    
    4.  Find a concise formula for $$\exp(B)$$.
    
4.  Find the determinant of the matrix

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix} 2&1&3&7 \\ 6&1&4&4 \\ 2&1&8&0 \\ 1&0&2&0 \end{pmatrix}.
    $$

5.  Is the determinant of a matrix a linear transformation into the real numbers
    $$\mathbb R$$? Explain or give a counterexample.
