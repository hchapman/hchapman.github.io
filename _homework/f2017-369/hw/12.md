**Notice**: This final homework assigment is due after our final midterm, but
the questions on it cover material that will be on the test. I encourage you to
work these problems before the test, although you don't need to have a set of
solutions written up until after.

1.  Let $$P_n$$ be the vector space of polynomials in $$x$$ of degree at most
    $$n$$, and let $$\frac d{dx}$$ be the derivative (a linear transformation on
    $$P_n$$).
    
    1.  What is the rank of $$\frac d{dx}$$?
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > If you've already answered part (b), the answer is $$\mathop{\rm rank}
    > \frac{d}{dx} = \dim{\mathop{\rm domain} \frac d{dx}} - \mathop{\rm null}
    > \frac{d}{dx} = \dim{P_n} - 1 = (n+1) - 1 = n$$.
    >
    > If you haven't: Derivatives of polynomials of degree at most $$n$$ have to
    > be polynomials of degree at most $$n-1$$. So, $$\mathop{\rm
    > rank}\frac{d}{dx} = \dim{P_{n-1}} = n$$.
    
    2.  What is the nullity of $$\frac d{dx}$$?
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > If you've already answered part (a), the answer is $$\mathop{\rm null}
    > \frac{d}{dx} = \dim{\mathop{\rm domain} \frac d{dx}} - \mathop{\rm rank}
    > \frac{d}{dx} = \dim{P_n} - n = (n+1) - n = 1$$.
    >
    > If you haven't: The only polynomials which differentiate to 0 are constant
    > polynomials (and all constant polynomials differentiate to 0). So,
    > $$\mathop{\rm null}\frac d{dx} = \dim{P_0} = 1$$.
    
    
2.  Let $$P_3$$ be the vector space of polynomials in $$x$$ of degree at most
    $$3$$. Then $$\langle f,g \rangle = \int_{0}^{10}{4f(x)g(x)\;dx}$$ is an
    inner product on $$P_3$$. If $$B$$ is an orthonormal basis for $$P_3$$ under
    this inner product, compute:
    
    $$
    \left\langle \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}_B, 
    \begin{pmatrix}6 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}_B\right\rangle
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > There's not enough information to solve this question using the formula
    > for the inner product (what on earth is $$B$$?). However, since $$B$$ is
    > orthonormal, the formula for the inner product of two $$B$$-vectors is
    > just the usual dot product formula, $$6 - 0 - 3 + 8 = 11$$.
    
3.  Find an orthonormal basis for the kernel of the matrix $$M$$:

    $$
    M = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & -2 & 3 \\ 1 & -6 & -1 & -9 \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}

    > B = \left\{ 
    > \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\            0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
    > \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\frac{3}{2} \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
    > \right\}
    > $$
    >
    > It turns out that $$B$$ is already orthogonal (why?) so we just have to
    > normalize it:

    > $$
    > O = \left\{ 
    > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\            0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix},
    > \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{13}{4}}} \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ -\frac{3}{2} \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
    > \right\}
    > $$


4.  For the following parts, a matrix or linear transformation is described.
    Explain whether or not it is **invertible**.
    
    1.  The linear transformation $$K$$ diagonalizes as
    
        $$
        D = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0 \\ 0&0&0 \\ 0&0&6\end{pmatrix}
        $$
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > It is not, since 0 is an eigenvalue of $$K$$ (why?) based on its
        > diagonalization.
        
    2.  The linear transformation $$L: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^n$$ scales
        volumes of hypercubes by a factor of $$1/2$$.
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > The determinant of a transformation is the quantity which expresses
        > how it scales the volumes of hypercubes. So, $$\det L = 1/2$$, which
        > is not zero, so $$L$$ is invertible.
        
    3.  The rank of the linear transformation $$H: \mathbb R^7 \to \mathbb R^7$$
        is 5.
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > For a matrix to be invertible, it must be full rank. However, $$5 \le
        > 7$$, so $$H$$ is not full rank, and so not invertible.
        
    4.  The linear transformation $$Q: \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb
        R^m$$ is surjective.
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > A surjective, square, linear transformation is invertible. So $$Q$$
        > is.
        
5.  Find the component of the velocity vector,
    
    $$
    \vec v = \begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 4 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    in the direction as the vector,
    
    $$
    \vec w = \begin{pmatrix}10 \\ 3 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > The component of a vector $$\vec v$$ in the direction of $$\vec w$$ is the
    > scaling multiple of $$\vec w$$ in the orthogonal decomposition of $$\vec
    > v$$:
    >
    > $$
    > \frac{\vec v \cdot \vec w}{\vec w \cdot \vec w} = \frac{20+12-2}{100+9+4}.
    > $$

6.  Find the least squares solution to the equation,

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 3 & 0 \\ 2 & 1\end{pmatrix}\vec x = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > The least squares solution to an equation $$M\vec x = \vec b$$ is the
    > solution to $$M^TM\vec x = M^T\vec b$$. We have that $$M^TM$$ is,
    >
    > $$
    > M^TM = \begin{pmatrix} 14 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
    > $$
    >
    > and $$M^T\vec b$$ is,
    >
    > $$
    > M^T \vec b = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}.
    > $$
    >
    > Solving the equation
    >
    > $$
    > \begin{pmatrix}14 & 1 \\ 1 & 2\end{pmatrix} \vec x = \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}
    > $$
    >
    > yields the least squares solution,
    >
    > $$
    > \vec x = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{9} \\ -\frac{5}{9} \end{pmatrix}.
    > $$
