**Notice**: This final homework assigment is due after our final midterm, but
the questions on it cover material that will be on the test. I encourage you to
work these problems before the test, although you don't need to have a set of
solutions written up until after.

1.  Let $$P_n$$ be the vector space of polynomials in $$x$$ of degree at most
    $$n$$, and let $$\frac d{dx}$$ be the derivative (a linear transformation on
    $$P_n$$).
    
    1.  What is the rank of $$\frac d{dx}$$?
    
    2.  What is the nullity of $$\frac d{dx}$$?
    
2.  Let $$P_3$$ be the vector space of polynomials in $$x$$ of degree at most
    $$3$$. Then $$\langle f,g \rangle = \int_{0}^{10}{4f(x)g(x)\;dx}$$ is an
    inner product on $$P_3$$. If $$B$$ is an orthonormal basis for $$P_3$$ under
    this inner product, compute:
    
    $$
    \left\langle \begin{pmatrix}1 \\ -1 \\ 3 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}_B, 
    \begin{pmatrix}6 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 4\end{pmatrix}_B\right\rangle
    $$
    
    
3.  Find an orthonormal basis for the kernel of the matrix $$M$$:

    $$
    M = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & -2 & 3 \\ 1 & -6 & -1 & -9 \end{pmatrix}
    $$

4.  For the following parts, a matrix or linear transformation is described.
    Explain whether or not it is **invertible**.
    
    1.  The matrix $$K$$ diagonalizes as
    
        $$
        K = \begin{pmatrix}1&0&0 \\ 0&0&0 \\ 0&0&6\end{pmatrix}
        $$
        
    2.  The linear transformation $$L: \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^n$$ scales
        volumes of hypercubes by a factor of $$1/2$$.
        
    3.  The rank of the linear transformation $$H: \mathbb R^7 \to \mathbb R^7$$
        is 5.
        
    4.  The linear transformation $$Q: \mathbb R^m \to \mathbb
        R^m$$ is surjective.
        
5.  Find the component of the velocity vector,
    
    $$
    \vec v = \begin{pmatrix}2 \\ 4 \\ -1\end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    in the direction as the vector,
    
    $$
    \vec w = \begin{pmatrix}10 \\ 3 \\ 2\end{pmatrix}
    $$

6.  Find the least squares solution to the equation,

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\ 3 & 0 \\ 2 & 1\end{pmatrix}\vec x = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}
    $$
