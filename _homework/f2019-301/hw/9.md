**Reading**: 
Read sections 8.1, 8.2, 8.3

**Exercises**:

1.  If a planar map has 46 vertices and 65 edges, how many faces must it have?
    
2.  Is it possible to find a set of 20 edges from \\(K_{10}\\), the complete
    graph on 10 vertices, such that if you remove those 20 edges then you obtain
    a planar graph? If so, draw such a graph as a planar map (with no edges
    crossing). If not, explain why not.


3.  Prove that the graph \\(K_{3,3}\\) is not planar *without using Kuratowski's
    theorem*. **Hint.** Notice that there are no triangles (cycles of length 3)
    in the graph.
