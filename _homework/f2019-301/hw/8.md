**Reading**: 
Read sections 12.1, 12.2, 12.3

**Exercises**:

1.  How many subgraphs does a cycle of length 4 have? Assume the vertices are labelled \\(a, b, c, d\\). We consider the subgraph with two vertices \\(a, b\\) and a single edge \\(ab\\) to be different from the subgraph with two vertices \\(b, c\\) and a single edge \\(bc\\).

    **Suggestion:** Count the number of subgraphs with 0 vertices, then the number of subgraphs with 1 vertex, and so on.

2.  

    1.  Draw a connected graph on 6 vertices with degrees 3,2,2,1,1,1.
    
    2.  Draw a disconnected graph on 6 vertices with degrees 3,2,2,1,1,1.

3.  The **distance** \\(d(u,v)\\) between two vertices \\(u,v\\) in a graph \\(G\\) is the length of the shortest path between them (If there is no path, the distance is infinite).

    1.  What is the largest distance between any two vertices in the path graph of \\(n\\) edges \\(P_n\\)?
    
    2.  What is the largest distance between any two vertices in the cycle graph of \\(n\\) edges \\(C_n\\)?
    
    3.  What is the largest distance between any two vertices in the complete graph of \\(n\\) vertices \\(K_n\\)?

4.  

    1.  Does \\(K_5\\) contain a closed Eulerian walk? Explain.
    
    2.  Does \\(K_6\\) contain a closed Eulerian walk? Explain.
