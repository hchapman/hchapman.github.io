**Reading**: 
Read sections 6.6, 6.7, 15.6

**Exercises**:

1.  Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find integers \\(m, n\\) in the equation \\(\gcd(91, 161) = m91 + n161\\).

2.  Show that for any two integers \\(a, b\\); \\(\DeclareMathOperator{lcm}{lcm}\gcd(a,b)\lcm(a,b) = ab\\).

3.  Find an integer \\(x\\) between 0 and 42 that satisfies \\(8x \equiv 4 \mod 43 \\).

4.  
    1.  Use the Euclidean Algorithm to compute \\(\gcd(89, 55)\\).
    
    2.  Notice that \\(89 = F_{11}\\) and \\(55 = F_{10}\\) are both Fibonacci
        numbers. Call a *division step* of the Euclidean Algorithm a step where
        we have \\(a < b\\) and we replace \\(\gcd(a,b)\\) by \\(\gcd(a,r)\\).
        
        Find inputs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) so that computing \\(\gcd(a,b)\\)
        requires at least 100 division steps.
