**Reading**: 
Read sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3

**Exercises**:

1.  Let's work out a small example of RSA encryption. You'll want a calculator! Feel free to use [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com), which will do the arithmetic for you. For example, if you type "536 mod 11" you'll get the smallest remainder 8, so that \\(536 \equiv 8 \mod 11\\).

    1.  Let \\(pq = 77\\), and \\(e = 13\\). Pick an integer message \\(0 \le x < 77\\).
    
    2.  Compute your encrypted message, that is, the smallest positive remainder \\(r\\) satisfying \\(x^e \equiv r \mod 77\\).
    
    3.  Using the private key \\(d = 37\\), what remainder must you find to decrypt your original message? Find the remainder. Does it agree with \\(x\\) from part a?
    
    4.  What are the primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)?

2.  True or False: If \\(a \equiv 0 \mod b\\) and \\(b \equiv 0 \mod c\\) then \\(a \equiv 0 \mod c\\).

3.  Devise a new scenario that can be described using graphs. Be sure to explain what the *vertices* are, and what the *edges* are.

4.  Draw an example of a graph or explain why one cannot exist: Is there a graph...

    1.  With 6 vertices all of which have degree 3?
    
    2.  With 5 vertices all of which have degree 3?
    
    3.  With 6 vertices of degrees 0,1,1,3,4,5?
    
    4.  With 7 vertices of degrees 2,2,2,2,3,3,6?
