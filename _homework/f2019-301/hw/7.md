**Reading**: 
Read sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3

**Exercises**:

1.  Let's work out a small example of RSA encryption. You'll want a calculator! Feel free to use [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com), which will do the arithmetic for you. For example, if you type "536 mod 11" you'll get the smallest remainder 8, so that \\(536 \equiv 8 \mod 11\\).

    1.  Let \\(pq = 77\\), and \\(e = 13\\). Pick an integer message \\(0 \le x < 77\\).
    
    2.  Compute your encrypted message, that is, the smallest positive remainder \\(r\\) satisfying \\(x^e \equiv r \mod 77\\).
    
    3.  Using the private key \\(d = 37\\), what remainder must you find to decrypt your original message? Find the remainder. Does it agree with \\(x\\) from part a?
    
    4.  What are the primes \\(p\\) and \\(q\\)?

    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    1.  We'll pick \\(x = 7\\) for this example.
    
    2.  \\(7^13 \equiv 35 \mod 77 \\).
    
    3.  \\(35^37 \equiv 7 \mod 77\\), our original message!
    
    4.  We factor \\(77\\) (it's only easy because it's such a small number) to get \\(p=7, q=11\\).
    
    </div>

2.  True or False: If \\(a \equiv 0 \mod b\\) and \\(b \equiv 0 \mod c\\) then \\(a \equiv 0 \mod c\\).

    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    True. The hypothesis is equivalent to saying \\(b \mid a\\) and \\(c \mid b\\), which implies that \\(c \mid a\\) by homework 5.3.a, which is equivalent to saying \\(a \equiv 0 \mod c\\).
    
    </div>

3.  Devise a new scenario that can be described using graphs. Be sure to explain what the *vertices* are, and what the *edges* are.

    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    For example, vertices could be airports and there could be an edge between
    airports if there is a direct flight between the two of them. We could
    answer questions like, "What's the smallest number of layovers you'd need to
    get from Denver to Nairobi?"
    
    </div>

4.  Draw an example of a graph or explain why one cannot exist: Is there a graph...

    1.  With 6 vertices all of which have degree 3?
    
    2.  With 5 vertices all of which have degree 3?
    
    3.  With 6 vertices of degrees 0,1,1,3,4,5?
    
    4.  With 7 vertices of degrees 2,2,2,2,3,3,6?
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    1.  Exists.
    
    2.  Can't exist; has an odd number of odd degree vertices.
    
    3.  Can't exist; the vertex of degree 5 must connect to the vertex of degree 0 which is impossible.
    
    4.  Exists.
    
    </div>
