**Reading**: 
1.  If you haven't yet, skim sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6.

2.  Read sections 1.7, 1.8, 2.1, and 2.4.

**Exercises**:

1.  
    1.  Suppose \\( \binom {n}{k-1} = 210 \\) and \\( \binom {n+1}k = 462 \\). What
        is \\( \binom nk \\)? (You can solve this without finding \\(n\\) and
        \\(k\\)).
        
    2.  Show that \\( \binom n2 + \binom{n+1}2 = n^2 \\). (I suggest you **do not** use induction).
    
2.  How many words of \\(3n\\) letters from the alphabet \\(\{a, b, c\}\\) have the same number of \\(a\\)s, \\(b\\)s, and \\(c\\)s?

3.  
    1.  How many ways can you place \\(n\\) rooks on an \\(n \times n\\) chessboard
        (that is, the chessboard is \\(n\\) squares by \\(n\\) squares) without any
        rook threatening another? (A rook threatens a piece if it lies on the same
        row or column).
        
    2.  How many ways can you place \\(k \ge 0\\) rooks on an \\(n \times n\\) chessboard?

4.  Can you cover a standard \\(8 \times 8\\) chessboard that has had two
    opposite corners removed entirely by non-overlapping \\(2 \times 1\\)
    dominoes? (You are allowed to rotate some dominoes).

5.  
    1.  If 95 people are seated in a row of 100 chairs, then show that some consecutive set of 16 chairs are filled with people.

    2.  If 95 people are seated in a circle of 100 chairs, show that some consecutive set of 19 chairs are filled with people.
