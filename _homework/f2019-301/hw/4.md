**Reading**: 
Read sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.

**Exercises**:

1.  Find the exact coefficient of \\(a^{314}b^{876}\\) in \\((1 + a + b)^{2019}\\).

2.  How many ways can you distribute \\(100\\) identical quarters to \\(8\\)
    people if each person is supposed to get at least \\(3\\) quarters?

3.  Recall from Calculus that, for any \\(k, m \in \mathbb N\\):

    $$
    \frac{d^k}{dx^k} x^m = \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
    \frac{m!}{k!}x^{m-k} & m \ge k \\
    0 & \textrm{otherwise}
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$
    
    Let \\(f(x) = (1 + x)^n\\). Show that 
    \\[\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} = \binom nk.\\] (Remember that \\(f^{(k)}\\) is the \\(k\\)th derivative of \\(f\\)).
    
4.  
    1.  Write out the first 20 rows of Pascal's even/odd triangle: The shape is
        the same as in Pascal's triangle, but write a 0 if the entry in Pascal's
        triangle was even, or a 1 if the entry was odd. For example, the first few rows are:
        
                   1     
                  1 1    
                 1 0 1   
                1 1 1 1  
               1 0 0 0 1 
              1 1 0 0 1 1
              
        **Hint**: Do you need to compute every binomial coefficient to do this?
        
    2.  Do you see any patterns? Describe them (with words or pictures).
    
    3.  Next to each row, write out its sum. Which rows are completely odd?
        **Challenge**: Can you think of a formula for the sums? (I don't know an easy formula. Try using words, or describe it recursively.)
    
5.  Explain why, for \\(k,m \in \mathbb N\\):
    \\[ \binom 0k + \binom 1k + \binom 2k + \cdots + \binom mk = \binom{m+1}{k+1}. \\]
