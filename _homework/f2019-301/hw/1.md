While you don't have to write formal proofs for many solutions, if you're only
writing symbols, you're not explaining things. Make sentences by adding in a few
English words to explain your reasoning to me.

1.  How many ways are there to pair up 5 students into two groups of two
    (leaving one odd-student-out)?

2.  How many subsets does that set $$A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}$$ have? How many of the
    subsets have cardinality 3?

3.  Let $$A$$ and $$B$$ be sets. If $$A \cap B = \emptyset$$, what is $$A \setminus B$$? $$A \Delta B$$?

4.  Explain why $$\vert A \cap B \vert + \vert A \cup B \vert = \vert A \vert + \vert B
    \vert$$. A picture will help.

5.  If one were to roll 4 identical 3-sided dice (ignoring for a moment how a
    3-sided die would look!), how many outcomes are possible?
