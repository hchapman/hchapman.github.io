1.  Prove that \\(5n + 5 \le n^2\\) for all integers \\(n \ge 6\\).

2.  Prove that \\(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + (n-1)^2 + n^2 =
    \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}6\\) for all integers \\(n \ge 1\\).
    
3.  An octal number (that is, a number written in base 8), is a number written with digits from the set \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\\}\\). How many octal numbers of 11 digits are there?

4.  
    1.  How many strings of length 5 can be written using the letters \\(\\{a,b,c,d,e,f\\}\\) if no two consecutive letters can be the same? For example, we'd count \\(adcde\\) but not \\(acdde\\).
    
    2.  How many strings of length 5 can be written using the letters \\(\\{a,b\\}\\) if no three consecutive letters can be the same? For example, we'd count \\(ababa\\) and \\(abbaa\\), but not \\(aaaba\\).
    
5.  Show that a nonempty set \\(S\\) has the same number of odd subsets (that
    is, subsets with an odd number of elements) as even subsets. (Hint: Start
    with a set \\(S\\) with odd cardinality and find a bijective correspondence.)
