1. (8.2 b,e) For each of the following sequences, determine its limit (usual Calculus reasoning will be helpful here), then prove that the sequence does indeed converge to this limit.

    1.  $$a_n = \frac {7n-19}{3n+7}$$
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. Consider $$N = \frac 16 \left( \frac {106}{3\epsilon} - 7 \right)$$. Then for $$n > N$$,
        >
        > $$
        > \left\vert \frac {7n-19}{3n+7} - \frac 73 \right\vert
        > = \frac {106}{3(3n + 7)} < \frac {106}{3(3N + 7)} = \epsilon.
        > $$
        >
        > So $$\lim a_n = 7/3$$.
   
    2.  $$s_n = \frac 1n \sin n$$
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. Consider $$N = 1/\epsilon$$ and $$n > N$$. Then
        >
        > $$ \left\vert \frac {\sin n}n \right\vert = \frac{\vert \sin n
        > \vert}{\vert n \vert} \le \frac 1{\vert n \vert} = \frac 1n < \frac 1N = \epsilon.
        > $$
        >
        > So $$\lim (\sin n)/n = 0$$.

2. (8.6) Let $$(s_n)$$ be a sequence in $$\mathbb R$$. 

    1.  Prove that $$\lim{s_n} = 0$$ if and only if 
        $$\lim{ | s_n | } = 0$$. (Hint:
        This is an "if and only if" statement, so you will need to prove both
        directions of the statement.)
       
        {:.solution .collapse}
       
        > ($$\Rightarrow$$) Suppose $$\lim s_n = 0$$. Consider $$\epsilon > 0$$. Then there exists
        > $$N$$ so that $$n > N$$ implies that $$\vert s_n \vert < \epsilon$$.
        >
        > Observe that $$\vert \vert s_n \vert - 0 \vert = \vert s_n \vert$$
        > which is less than $$\epsilon$$ by above. So $$\lim \vert s_n \vert = 0$$.
        >
        > ($$\Leftarrow$$) The reverse direction is very similar to the forward direction.
   
    2.  Prove that if $$s_n = (-1)^n$$ that 
        $$\lim{|s_n|}$$ exists but $$s_n$$ diverges.
       
        {:.solution .collapse}
       
        > We have that $$s_n$$ diverges by Example 4 in Section 8 (pp41-42).
        > Also, $$\vert s_n \vert = 1$$ which converges to $$1$$ as it is
        > constant.
   
3. (7.4) Give examples of

    1.  A sequence of irrational numbers converging to a rational number
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
    
        > For example, let $$s_n = \pi/2^n$$.
   
    2.  A sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
    
        > For example, let $$s_n = \sum_{k=0}^n{1/(k!)}$$ which converges to $$e$$.
   
4. For each of the following false statements, give a counterexample.

    1.  If $$s_n$$ and $$t_n$$ are two divergent sequences, their sum $$s_n + t_n$$ also diverges.
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
    
        > For example, let $$s_n$$ diverge and let $$t_n = -s_n$$.
   
    2.  If a sequence $$s_n$$ converges, so too does the sequence $$t_n = \sum_{i=1}^n{s_i}$$.
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
    
        > For example, let $$s_n = 1/n$$.
   
    3.  If the sequence $$s_n$$ converges and the sequence $$t_n$$ diverges, the product $$s_nt_n$$ also diverges.
    
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > For example, let $$t_n$$ be any divergent sequence and let $$s_n = 0$$.
        >
        > Another example, let $$t_n$$ be any divergent, nonzero sequence and let $$s_n = 1/t_n$$.
    
5. (9.12) Suppose $$s_n \ne 0$$ for all $$n \in \mathbb N$$ and that the limit
   $$\lim {\left|\frac{s_{n+1}}{s_n}\right|} = L$$ exists.
   
    1. Show that if $$L < 1$$ then $$\lim s_n = 0$$.
    
       {:.solution .collapse}
    
       > **Proof**. As $$L < 1$$ there exists a number $$L < a < 1$$ by the
       > Completeness Axiom. Consider $$\epsilon = a - L$$ which is positive as $$L
       > < a$$.
       >
       > *Claim: There exists $$N$$ such that for all $$n \ge N$$, $$ \vert
       > s_{n+1}\vert < a \vert s_n\vert$$*. Let $$N \in \mathbb N$$ be that for which 
       >
       > $$
       > \left\vert
       > \left\vert \frac {s_{n+1}}{s_n} \right\vert - L \right\vert < \epsilon
       > $$
       >
       > for all $$n \ge N$$, which exists as $$\lim {\left\vert
       > \frac{s_{n+1}}{s_n}\right\vert} = L$$. (Notice: For simplicity's sake,
       > we're taking $$N$$ here so that even $$n = N$$ satisfies the convergence
       > inequality. We may do this, as once we know $$N$$ with the strict
       > inequality exists, we can just choose the next natural number larger by
       > the Archimedean Property.) So, for such $$n$$ we have that
       >
       > $$
       > L - \epsilon < \left\vert \frac {s_{n+1}}{s_n} \right\vert < L + \epsilon = a.
       > $$
       >
       > Notice that the right part of this inequality implies that $$\vert s_{n+1}
       > \vert < a \vert s_n \vert$$, as claimed.
       >
       > *Claim: For all natural numbers $$k$$, $$\vert s_{N+k}\vert < a^k \vert
       > s_N\vert$$*. We prove this using induction on $$k$$. The base case of $$k=1$$ we have already
       > shown, by taking $$n = N$$ in the inequality $$\vert s_{n+1} \vert < a
       > \vert s_n \vert$$ which is true by choice of $$N$$.
       >
       > Suppose now that $$\vert s_{N+k} \vert < a^k \vert s_N \vert$$. We have
       > that $$N+k \ge N$$, so we know that $$\vert s_{(N+k)+1} \vert < a \vert
       > s_{N+k} \vert$$. By our inductive hypothesis, we have that 
       >
       > $$\vert s_{(N+k)+1} \vert < a \vert s_{N+k} \vert < a (a^k \vert s_N \vert) = a^{k+1}\vert s_N \vert,$$
       >
       > so by induction the claim is true.
       >
       > *Claim: $$\lim s_n = 0$$*. Observe that we have now that $$0 < \vert
       > s_{N+k} \vert < a^k \vert s_N \vert$$. Consider $$n > N$$; then consider
       > $$k = n-N$$, which is a natural number as $$N \in \mathbb N$$ and $$n > N$$. So
       >
       > $$
       > 0 < \vert s_{n} \vert < a^n \left\vert \frac {s_N}{a^N} \right\vert
       > $$
       >
       > Notice we're actually considering the sequence $$ (\vert s_n
       > \vert)_{n=N}^{\infty}$$ here. But think about why if we can prove the limit
       > for this sequence, we've also proved the limit for the full sequence as well.
       >
       > The LHS has limit $$0$$, and the RHS has limit $$0$$ (why?). So by the
       > squeeze theorem, the sequence $$(\vert s_n
       > \vert)_{n=N}^{\infty}$$ has limit 0 and so $$\lim \vert s_n \vert = 0$$ as
       > well. By question (2a), this means $$\lim s_n = 0$$. $$\Box$$
    
   
    2. Show that if $$L > 1$$ 
      then $$\lim | s_n | = +\infty$$.
      
      {:.solution .collapse}
      
      > Consider the sequence $$t_n = 1/s_n$$. So
      >
      > $$
      > \lim \left\vert \frac{t_{n+1}}{t_n} \right\vert = \lim \left\vert \frac{s_{n}}{s_{n+1}} \right\vert = 1/L < 1.
      > $$
      >
      > So $$\lim t_n = 0$$ and by question 2a, $$\lim \vert t_n \vert = 0$$. As
      > $$\vert s_n \vert$$ is a positive sequence and $$\lim 1/\vert s_n \vert =
      > \lim \vert t_n \vert = 0$$ we have that $$\lim \vert s_n \vert = +\infty$$.
