1. (8.2 b,e) For each of the following sequences, determine its limit (usual Calculus reasoning will be helpful here), then prove that the sequence does indeed converge to this limit.

    1.  $$a_n = \frac {7n-19}{3n+7}$$
   
    2.  $$s_n = \frac 1n \sin n$$

2. (8.6) Let $$(s_n)$$ be a sequence in $$\mathbb R$$. 

    1.  Prove that $$\lim{s_n} = 0$$ if and only if 
       $$\lim{ | s_n | } = 0$$. (Hint:
       This is an "if and only if" statement, so you will need to prove both
       directions of the statement.)
   
    2.  Prove that if $$s_n = (-1)^n $$ that 
       $$\lim{|s_n|}$$ exists but $$s_n$$ diverges.
   
3. (7.4) Give examples of

    1.  A sequence of irrational numbers converging to a rational number
   
    2.  A sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number
   
4. For each of the following false statements, give a counterexample.

    1.  If $$s_n$$ and $$t_n$$ are two divergent sequences, their sum $$s_n + t_n$$ also diverges.
   
    2.  If a sequence $$s_n$$ converges, so too does the sequence $$t_n = \sum_{i=1}^n{s_i}$$.
   
    3.  If the sequence $$s_n$$ converges and the sequence $$t_n$$ diverges, the product $$s_nt_n$$ also diverges.
   
5. (9.12) Suppose $$s_n \ne 0$$ for all $$n \in \mathbb N$$ and that the limit
   $$\lim {\left|\frac{s_{n+1}}{s_n}\right|} = L$$ exists.
   
    1. Show that if $$L < 1$$ then $$\lim s_n = 0$$.
   
    2. Show that if $$L > 1$$ 
      then $$\lim | s_n | = +\infty$$.
