1. (10.5) Complete the proof of Theorem 10.4 by showing that if $$(s_n)$$ is an
   unbounded decreasing sequence, that $$\lim s_n = -\infty$$.
     
2. Let $$(s_n)$$ be a sequence defined by $$s_1 = \sqrt 2$$ and $$s_{n+1} =
   \sqrt{2 + \sqrt {s_n}}$$. Show that $$(s_n)$$ converges to a real number.
   You may use that if $$0 \le a \le b$$ then $$0 \le \sqrt a
   \le \sqrt b$$. (**Hint**: Use the Monotone Convergence Theorem.)


3.  (10.8) Let $$(s_n)$$ be an increasing sequence of positive numbers. Let
    $$(\sigma_n)$$ be defined by,
   
    $$
    \sigma_n = \frac{s_1 + s_2 + \cdots + s_n}{n}.
    $$

    Prove that $$(\sigma_n)$$ is in increasing sequence. (The $$\sigma_n$$ are called
    *Cesaro means*)
 
4.  For each of the following sequences, find the $$\liminf$$ and the
    $$\limsup$$.
   
    1. $$a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n}$$
   
    2. $$b_n = n \cos \left( \frac {n\pi}{4} \right)$$
   
    3. $$c_n = (-1)^n + \frac 1n$$
 
5. (11.8) Prove that $$\liminf s_n = -\limsup(-s_n)$$ for any sequence $$s_n$$. You
   may use the result of exercise 5.4 without proving it.
