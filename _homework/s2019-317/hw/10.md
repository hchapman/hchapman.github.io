1.  (33.2) Let $$S$$ be a nonempty bounded subset of $$\mathbb R$$. For fixed
    $$c > 0$$, let $$cS = \{ cs : s \in S \}$$. Show that $$\sup(cS) =
    c\cdot\sup(S)$$ and $$\inf(cS) = c\cdot\inf(S)$$.

    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. Let $$M = \sup S$$. Then $$cM$$ is an upper bound for $$cS$$ as
    for all $$cs \in cS$$ we have that $$M \ge s$$ so $$cM \ge cs$$ as $$c >
    0$$.
    
    Now, if $$\alpha \ge cs$$ for all $$cs \in cS$$ (that is, $$\alpha$$ is an
    upper bound for $$cS$$), then $$\alpha/c \ge s$$ for all $$s \in S$$ so
    $$\alpha$$ is an upper bound for $$S$$. But then $$M \le \alpha/c$$ as $$M$$
    is the least upper bound for $$S$$, so $$cM \le \alpha$$. So
    $$cM = c\sup S = \sup(cS)$$.
    
    Now notice that $$\inf(cS) = -\sup(-cS) = -c\sup(-S) = c\inf S$$. $$\Box$$

2.  (33.6) Let $$f$$ be integrable on $$[a,b]$$. Prove that, for any subset $$S
    \subseteq [a, b]$$ we have
    
    $$
    M(|f|, S) - m(|f|, S) \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)
    $$
    
    *Hint*. For $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$, we have $$\vert f(x_0)\vert - \vert f(y_0)\vert \le \vert f(x_0) -
    f(y_0)\vert \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. The first part of the hint follows from the triangle inequality, as
    
    $$
    \vert f(x_0)\vert = \vert f(x_0) - f(y_0) + f(y_0) \vert \le \vert
    f(x_0) - f(y_0) \vert + \vert f(y_0) \vert.
    $$
    
    The second part of the hint comes from how $$M(f, S) \ge f(x_0)$$ and $$m(f,
    S) \le f(y_0)$$ for all $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$.
    
    On the other hand, we have that for any $$\epsilon > 0$$, properties of the
    supremum and infimum guarantee that there exists $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$ so that,
    
    $$
    M(\vert f\vert, S) < \vert f(x_0)\vert + \epsilon/2 \quad\textrm{and}
    \quad m(\vert f\vert, S) > \vert f(y_0) \vert - \epsilon/2.
    $$
    
    So we have that,
    
    $$
    M(\vert f\vert, S) - m(\vert f\vert, S) < \vert f(x_0)\vert - \vert f(y_0) \vert
    + \epsilon \le M(f, S) - m(f, S) + \epsilon.
    $$
    
    This holds for all $$\epsilon > 0$$, so we conclude that the desired
    inequality holds. $$\Box$$

3.  (33.5) Show that $$\left\vert \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \sin^8(e^x)\; dx \right\vert \le \frac{16\pi^3}{3}$$.

    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. Using Theorems 33.4 and 33.5, together with the FTC I (for
    example), we have that (as $$\left\vert \sin^8(e^x )\right\vert \le 1$$)
    
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \left\vert \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \sin^8(e^x)\; dx \right\vert
    &\le  \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} \left\vert x^2 \sin^8(e^x) \right\vert\; dx \\
    &\le \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} \left\vert x^2 \right\vert\; dx = \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \; dx \\
    &\le \frac{16\pi^3}3. \Box
    \end{align*}
    $$

4.  (33.8) Let $$f$$ and $$g$$ be integrable functions on $$[a, b]$$.

    1.  It is a fact (see Exercise 33.7) that if $$h$$ is integrable on
        $$[a,b]$$, then so is $$h^2$$. Prove that $$fg$$ is integrable on $$[a,
        b]$$. *Hint*. Use that $$4fg = (f+g)^2 - (f-g)^2$$.
        
    2.  Show that $$\max(f,g)$$ and $$\min(f,g)$$ are integrable on $$[a, b]$$.
        You may use the results of Excercise 17.8 without proof.
        
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    Use that for integrable functions $$f, g$$ we have that $$f+g$$, $$f-g$$,
    $$(f+g)^2$$, $$(f-g)^2$$, $$\vert f-g \vert$$ are all integrable. Further
    applications of linearity of the integral prove (a), and together with
    $$\min(f,g) = \frac 12 (f+g) - \frac 12 \vert f-g \vert$$ prove the first
    part of (b). The second part then follows from $$\max(f,g) = -\min(-f,-g)$$
    and integrability of $$-f$$, etc.

5.  (33.10) Let $$f$$ be the function,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}\sin(\frac 1x) & x \ne 0\\0 & x=0\end{array}\right.
    $$
    
    Prove that $$f$$ is integrable on $$[-1, 1]$$. *Hint*. See Excercise
    33.11(c) and its solution in the textbook. (Why can we not apply the
    Dominated Convergence Theorem to prove that $$f$$ is integrable?)
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **Proof**. Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. Notice that $$f$$ is continuous on each of
    $$[-1, -\epsilon/8]$$ and $$[\epsilon/8, 1]$$, and is hence integrable. This
    means that there exist partitions $$Q_1$$ of $$[-1, -\epsilon/8]$$ and
    $$Q_2$$ of $$[\epsilon/8, 1]$$ so that
    
    $$
    U(f, Q_1) - L(f, Q_1) < \epsilon/4 \quad\text{and}\quad
    U(f, Q_2) - L(f, Q_2) < \epsilon/4.
    $$
    
    Notice that $$P = Q_1 \cup Q_2$$ is a partition of $$[-1, 1]$$ and
    furthermore that
    
    $$
    U(f, P) = U(f, Q_1) + \epsilon/4 + U(f, Q_2)
    $$
    
    and,
    
    $$
    L(f, P) = L(f, Q_1) - \epsilon/4 + L(f, Q_2).
    $$
    
    (Why? The only terms in the two sums are those contributed by the interval
    $$[-\epsilon/8, \epsilon/8]$$ but we know that the supremum and infimum of
    $$f$$ on any such interval are $$1$$ and $$-1$$ respectively and that the
    width of this interval is $$\epsilon/4$$) So,
    
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    U(f, P) - L(f, P)
    &= (U(f, Q_1) + \epsilon/4 + U(f, Q_2)) - (L(f, Q_1) - \epsilon/4 + L(f, Q_2)) \\
    &= (U(f, Q_1) - L(f, Q_1)) + (U(f, Q_2) - L(f, Q_2)) + \epsilon/2 \\
    &< \epsilon/4 + \epsilon/4 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon.
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    We can find any such $$P$$ for any $$\epsilon > 0$$, so we conclude that
    $$f$$ is integrable on $$[-1, 1]$$.
