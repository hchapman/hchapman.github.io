1.  (33.2) Let $$S$$ be a nonempty bounded subset of $$\mathbb R$$. For fixed
    $$c > 0$$, let $$cS = \{ cs : s \in S \}$$. Show that $$\sup(cS) =
    c\cdot\sup(S)$$ and $$\inf(cS) = c\cdot\inf(S)$$.
    
2.  (33.6) Let $$f$$ be integrable on $$[a,b]$$. Prove that, for any subset $$S
    \subseteq [a, b]$$ we have
    
    $$
    M(|f|, S) - m(|f|, S) \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)
    $$
    
    *Hint*. For $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$, we have $$\vert f(x_0)\vert - \vert f(y_0)\vert \le \vert f(x_0) -
    f(y_0)\vert \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)$$.
    
3.  (33.5) Show that $$\left\vert \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \sin^8(e^x)\; dx \right\vert \le \frac{16\pi^3}{3}$$.

4.  (33.8) Let $$f$$ and $$g$$ be integrable functions on $$[a, b]$$.

    1.  It is a fact (see Exercise 33.7) that if $$h$$ is integrable on
        $$[a,b]$$, then so is $$h^2$$. Prove that $$fg$$ is integrable on $$[a,
        b]$$. *Hint*. Use that $$4fg = (f+g)^2 - (f-g)^2$$.
        
    2.  Show that $$\max(f,g)$$ and $$\min(f,g)$$ are integrable on $$[a, b]$$.
        You may use the results of Excercise 17.8 without proof.
    
5.  (33.10) Let $$f$$ be the function,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}\sin(\frac 1x) & x \ne 0\\0 & x=0\end{array}\right.
    $$
    
    Prove that $$f$$ is integrable on $$[-1, 1]$$. *Hint*. Either use the
    Dominated Convergence Theorem, or see Excercise 33.11(c) and its solution in
    the textbook.
