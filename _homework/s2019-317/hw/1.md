1.  (1.1) Prove $$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \tfrac 16 n(n+1)(2n+1)$$ for
    all positive integers $$n$$.
    
2.  (1.6) Prove $$11^n - 4^n$$ is divisible by 7 when $$n$$ is a positive
    integer. (An integer $$k$$ is divisible by an integer $$q$$ if there exists
    an integer $$m$$ so that $$k = mq$$.)

3.  (4.3, partial) For each subset of $$\mathbb R$$ below, determine both the
    **supremum** and the **infimum**, if they exist. If either doesn't exist,
    say so. You do not need to give a rigorous proof of your answer.
    
    1.  $$A = \{ 3, 4, 5 \}$$
    
    2.  $$B = \left\{n + \dfrac {(-1)^n}n \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    3.  $$C = \left\{\sin\left(\dfrac{n\pi}{3}\right) \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    4.  $$D = \{ r \;:\; r \in \mathbb Q,\; r^2 < 3 \}$$
    
    5.  $$E = \left\{ 1 - \dfrac{1}{3^n} \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$

4.  Don't worry about writing out any formal proofs in this problem. Decide
    whether each of the following statements is true. If the statement is **true**,
    you don't need to do anything more. If the statement is **false**, give a
    concrete example (that is, a counterexample) that shows the statement
    failing.
    
    1.  For a nonempty, bounded set $$S \subseteq \mathbb R$$, $$\inf S < \sup
        S$$.
    
    2.  If $$r \ne 0$$ is rational and $$\alpha$$ is irrational, then
        $$r\alpha$$ is irrational.
        
    3.  If $$T \subset S \subset \mathbb R$$, $$T$$ is nonempty and $$S$$ is
        bounded, then $$\sup T \le \sup S$$.
        
    4.  A finite, nonempty set always contains its supremum.
    
5.  Let $$A$$ be a nonempty set of real numbers which is bounded below. Let
    $$-A$$ be the set $$\{ -x \;:\; x \in A \}$$. Prove that
    
    $$
    \inf A = -\sup(-A).
    $$
    
    (Note: This is the bulk of the proof of Corollary 4.5. You're welcome to make use of all of the theorems and properties in Section 3, including Theorem 3.2. $$\mathbb R$$ is an ordered field.)
