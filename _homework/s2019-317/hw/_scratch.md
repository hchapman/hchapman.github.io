3.  Let $$E \subseteq \mathbb R$$ be a set of real numbers. An element $$s_0 \in
    E$$ is *interior* to $$E$$ if for some $$r > 0$$ we have
    
    $$
    \{ s \in S : |s - s_0| < r\} \subset E.
    $$
    
    The set $$E$$ is *open in $$\mathbb R$$* if every point in $$E$$ is interior
    to $$E$$.
