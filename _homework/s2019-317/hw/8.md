1.  (29.4) Let $$f$$ and $$g$$ be differentiable functions on an open interval
    $$I$$. Suppose there are $$a,b \in I$$ with $$a < b$$ and $$f(a) = f(b) =
    0$$. Show that there exists $$x \in I$$ so that
    
    $$
    f'(x) + f(x)g'(x) = 0.
    $$
    
    *Hint*. Consider $$h(x) = f(x) e^{g(x)}$$.
    
2.  (31.2) Consider the *hyperbolic sine and cosine* functions, $$\sinh(x) =
    \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$ and $$\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}$$.
    
    1.  Find the Taylor series for $$\sinh(x)$$ and show that it converges to $$\sinh(x)$$.
    
    2.  Find the Taylor series for $$\cosh(x)$$ and show that it converges to $$\cosh(x)$$.
    
3.  (31.6) We're going to work through an alternative proof of Taylor's theorem,
    for Taylor series centered at $$c = 0$$.
    
    Let $$f$$ be defined on $$(a, b)$$ with $$a < 0 < b$$ and assume that, for
    given $$n \in \mathbb N$$, $$f^{(n)}$$ exists on $$(a, b)$$. Let $$x > 0$$,
    and take $$M$$ to be the unique number so that
    
    $$
    f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{\frac{f^{(k)}(0)}{k!} x^k + \frac{Mx^n}{n!}}
    $$

    is valid. Define
    
    $$
    F(t) = f(t) + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\frac{(x-t)^k}{k!}f^{(k)}(t) + M\frac{(x-t)^n}{n!}}
    $$
    
    for $$t \in [0, x]$$. **An earlier version had a typo, saying that $$F$$ was
    a function of $$x$$, instead of $$t$$. The version now is correct.**
    
    1.  Show that $$F$$ is differentiable on $$[0, x]$$ and that furthermore
    
        $$
        F'(t) = \frac{(x-t)^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}[f^{(n)}(t) - M].
        $$
        
    2.  Show $$F(0) = F(x)$$.
    
    3.  Apply Rolle's Theorem to obtain $$y \in (0, x)$$ so that $$f^{(n)}(y) = M$$.

4.  Let $$f$$ be differentiable on $$\mathbb R$$ with $$a = \sup\{ \vert f'(x) \vert : x \in \mathbb R \} < 1$$.

    1.  Select $$s_0 \in \mathbb R$$ and define $$s_n = f(s_{n-1})$$ for $$n \ge 1$$.
    
        Prove that $$(s_n)$$ is a convergent sequence. *Hint*. To show that
        $$(s_n)$$ is Cauchy, first show that $$\vert s_{n+1} - s_n \vert \le a
        \vert s_n - s_{n-1}\vert$$ for $$n \ge 1$$.
        
    2.  Show that $$f$$ has a *fixed point*. In other words, there is a number
        $$s$$ so that $$f(s) = s$$.
