1.  (28.8) Let $$f(x) = x^2$$ when $$x$$ is rational and $$f(x) = 0$$ otherwise.

    1.  Show that $$f$$ is continuous at $$0$$.
    
    2.  Show that $$f$$ is discontinuous at all $$x \ne 0$$.
    
    3.  Prove that $$f$$ is differentiable at $$0$$. (It is insufficient to
        simply claim $$f'(x) = 2x$$)

2.  (28.14) Suppose $$f$$ is differentiable at $$a$$.

    1.  Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = f'(a)$$.
    
    2.  Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h} = f'(a)$$.

3.  (29.5) Let $$f$$ be a real-valued function which is differentiable on $$\mathbb R$$.
    Prove that if $$\vert f(x)-f(y) \vert <
    (x-y)^2$$ for all $$x, y \in \mathbb R$$, then $$f$$ is a constant function.

4. (29.9) Show that $$ex \le e^x$$ for all $$x \in \mathbb R$$.

5.  Let $$f$$ be real-valued and differentiable on $$\mathbb R$$, and let $$g(x)
    = f(x+1) - f(x)$$. Suppose additionally that $$\lim_{x\to \infty} f'(x) = 0$$.
   
    Prove that $$\lim_{x\to\infty} g(x) = 0$$.
