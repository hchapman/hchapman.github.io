1.  (19.4)

    1.  Prove that if $$f$$ is uniformly continuous on a bounded set $$S$$, then
        $$f$$ is a bounded function on $$S$$. (*Hint*: Try proof by contradiction.)
        
    2.  Explain why (a) gives a proof that $$1/x^2$$ is not uniformly continuous
        on $$(0, 1)$$.
        
2.  (23.1, 23.2) For each of the following power series, find the radius of convergence
    and determine the exact interval of convergence.
    
    1. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left(\dfrac xn\right)^n$$
    
    2. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left(\dfrac {n^3}{3^n}\right)x^n$$
    
    3. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left( \dfrac{3^n}{n 4^n} \right)x^n$$
    
    4. \$$\displaystyle\sum x^{n!}$$

3.  (24.4) For $$x \in [0, \infty)$$, let $$f_n(x) = \dfrac{x^n}{1 + x^n}$$.

    1.  Find $$f(x) = \lim f_n(x)$$, the pointwise limit of $$(f_n)$$.
    
    2.  Determine whether $$f_n \to f$$ uniformly on $$[0, 1]$$.
    
    3.  Determine whether $$f_n \to f$$ uniformly on $$[0, \infty)$$.
