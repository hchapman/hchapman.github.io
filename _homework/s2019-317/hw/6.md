1.  (19.4)

    1.  Prove that if $$f$$ is uniformly continuous on a bounded set $$S$$, then
        $$f$$ is a bounded function on $$S$$. (*Hint*: Try proof by contradiction.)
        
        {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
        <div class="solution collapse">
        
        **Proof**. Assume that $$f$$ is uniformly continuous on $$S$$ but
        suppose to the contrary that $$f$$ is unbounded on $$S$$. Then for all
        $$n \in \mathbb N$$, there exists as number $$x_n$$ so that $$f(x_n) >
        n$$. Use these to define the sequence $$(x_n)$$.
        
        $$S$$ is bounded, so by the Bolzano-Weierstrauss theorem, there exists a
        convergent, *hence Cauchy*, subsequence $$(x_{n_k})$$. As $$f$$ is
        assumed to be uniformly continuous, this means that $$(f(x_{n_k}))$$ is
        itself a Cauchy, hence convergent, sequence. Say it converges to the
        number $$y$$.
        
        But for all $$n_k > y$$, we have that $$f(x_{n_k}) > n_k > y$$. This
        implies that the sequence cannot possibly converge to $$y$$, a
        contradiction. Hence $$f$$ must be bounded on $$S$$. $$\Box$$

    2.  Explain why (a) gives a proof that $$1/x^2$$ is not uniformly continuous
        on $$(0, 1)$$.
        
        {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
        <div class="solution collapse">
        
        $$1/x^2$$ is unbounded on $$(0,1)$$, so it cannot be uniformly continuous.
        
        </div>
        
2.  (23.1, 23.2) For each of the following power series, find the radius of convergence
    and determine the exact interval of convergence.
    
    1. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left(\dfrac xn\right)^n$$
    
       {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       The interval of convergence is $$(-\infty, \infty)$$.
       
       </div>
    
    2. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left(\dfrac {n^3}{3^n}\right)x^n$$
    
       {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       The interval of convergence is $$(-3, 3)$$.
       
       </div>
    
    3. \$$\displaystyle\sum \left( \dfrac{3^n}{n 4^n} \right)x^n$$
    
       {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       The interval of convergence is $$[-4/3, 4/3)$$.
       
       </div>
    
    4. \$$\displaystyle\sum x^{n!}$$
    
       {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       Notice that the sequence of terms is $$a_n = 1$$ if $$n = k!$$ for some
       $$k \in \mathbb N$$, or $$a_n = 0$$ otherwise (if the series index starts
       at 0 instead of 1, then $$a_1 = 2$$, but this does not change the tail of
       the sequence). Hence the limit superior of the roots of terms is going to
       be $$1$$.
       
       The interval of convergence is $$(-1, 1)$$.
       
       </div>

3.  (24.4) For $$x \in [0, \infty)$$, let $$f_n(x) = \dfrac{x^n}{1 + x^n}$$.

    1.  Find $$f(x) = \lim f_n(x)$$, the pointwise limit of $$(f_n)$$.
    
        {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       The pointwise limit is the function
       
       $$
       f = \left\{
       \begin{array}{3}
       0 &\;& 0 \le x < 1 \\ 
       1/2 &\;& x = 1 \\ 
       1 &\;& 1 < x
       \end{array}\right.
       $$
       
       To see this, take $$x$$ to be in any of these cases and evaluate the limit $$\lim x^n/(1 + x^n)$$.
       
       </div>
    
    2.  Determine whether $$f_n \to f$$ uniformly on $$[0, 1]$$.
    
        {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       It cannot, as the pointwise limit is not continuous on $$[0, 1]$$, while each of the functions $$f_n$$ are.
       
       </div>
    
    3.  Determine whether $$f_n \to f$$ uniformly on $$[0, \infty)$$.
    
        {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
       <div class="solution collapse">
       
       It cannot, as the pointwise limit is not continuous on $$[0, \infty)$$, while each of the functions $$f_n$$ are.
       
       </div>
