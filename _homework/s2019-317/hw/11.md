1.  (34.4) Let $$f$$ be the function,

    $$
    f(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
    t & t < 0\\
    t^2+1 & 0 \le t \le 2\\
    0 & t > 2 \end
    {array}\right.
    $$
    
    1.  Determine the function $$F(x) = \int_0^x f(t)\; dt$$.
    
    2.  Sketch $$F$$. Where is $$F$$ continuous?
    
    3.  Where is $$F$$ differentiable? Calculate $$F'$$ at the points of differentiability.

    1.  $$
        F(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        t^2 & t < 0\\
        t^3/3+t & 0 \le t \le 2\\
        14/3 & t > 2 \end
        {array}\right.
        $$
        
    2.  By the FTC II, $$F(x)$$ is continuous everywhere.
    
    3.  By the FTC II, $$F(x)$$ is differentiable everywhere that $$f(x)$$ is
        continuous, hence at all $$x$$ except possibly $$x=0$$ and $$x=2$$.
        
        We can prove that $$F(x)$$ is not differentiable at $$x=0$$ and $$x=2$$
        by showing that the left-hand and right-hand difference quotient limits
        disagree.

2.  (34.6) Let $$f$$ be a continuous function on $$\mathbb R$$ and define

    $$
    F(x) = \int_0^{\sin x}{f(t)\; dt}\quad\textrm{for } x \in \mathbb R.
    $$
    
    Show that $$F$$ is differentiable on $$\mathbb R$$ and compute $$F'$$.

    <div class="solution collapse">

    Let $$G(x) = \int_0^x{f(t)\; dt}$$. Then $$G(x)$$ is differentiable and
    $$G'(x) = f(x)$$ by the FTC II as $$f$$ is continuous. Notice that $$F(x) =
    G(\sin x)$$. So by the chain rule, $$F$$ is differentiable and $$F'(x) =
    G'(\sin x)\cos x = f(\sin x)\cos x$$.

3.  (34.11) Suppose $$f$$ is a continuous function on $$[a, b]$$. Show that if
    $$\int_a^b{f(x)^2\; dx} = 0$$, then $$f(x) = 0$$ for all $$x \in [a, b]$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof:** We have that $$f^2(x) \ge 0$$ and $$f^2(x)$$ is continuous as
    $$f$$ is, so by Theorem 33.4(ii) $$f^2(x) = 0$$. By factoring, this is only
    possible if $$f(x) = 0$$. $$\Box$$

    </div>


4.  (34.12) Show that if $$f$$ is a continuous real-valued function on $$[a,
    b]$$ satisfying $$\int_a^b{f(x)g(x)\; dx} = 0$$ for every continuous
    function $$g$$ on $$[a, b]$$, then $$f(x) = 0$$ for all $$x \in [a, b]$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. As the statement is true for all $$g$$, it is true for $$g = f$$.
    Then this is true by question (3). $$\Box$$

5.  For this problem, you may use the results of questions (3) and (4) freely.
    Let $$C([a, b])$$ be the set of all continuous functions on the interval
    $$[a, b]$$. Define a function 
    
    $$
    \langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle: C([a, b])
    \times C([a, b]) \to \mathbb R
    $$
    
    by,
    
    $$
    \langle f, g \rangle = \int_a^b{fg}
    $$
    
    1.  Let $$f, g, h \in C([a,b])$$. Show that $$\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$$
        is an *inner product*. That is, show each of:
        
        +  $$\langle f,g \rangle = \langle g,f \rangle$$.
        
        +  $$\langle af,g \rangle = a\langle f,g \rangle$$.
        
        +  $$\langle f+h,g \rangle = \langle f,g \rangle + \langle h, g\rangle$$.
        
        +  $$\langle f, f\rangle = 0$$ if and only if $$f = 0$$.
        
    2.  Let $$f \in C([a,b])$$. Show that if $$\langle f, g \rangle = 0$$ for
        all $$g \in C([a,b])$$, then $$f = 0$$. In other words, you are showing
        that the only function *orthogonal* to all other functions with this
        inner product is the zero function.
