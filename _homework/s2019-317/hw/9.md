1.  (32.2) Let the function $$f$$ be defined as,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}
    x\;\; & x \in \mathbb Q \\
    0\;\; & x \in \mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$
    
    1.  Compute the upper and lower Darboux integrals for $$f$$ on the interval $$[0,b]$$.
    
        *Hint*. Here's how you can show that $$U(f) \ge b^2/2$$: For any partition
        $$Q$$, if $$P_n = \{\cdots \frac{kb}n \cdots\}$$, explain why 
        
        $$
        U(f, Q \cup P_n) \ge \sum_{k=1}^{n}{ \frac{(k-1)b}{n} \left(\frac bn\right) }.
        $$
    
    2.  Is $$f$$ integrable on the interval $$[0, b]$$?

    1.  For any interval $$I$$, by density of the irrationals, we have that
        $$m(f, I) = 0$$. So, for any partition $$P$$ of $$[0, b]$$, we have that
        $$L(f,P) = 0$$, so we conclude that $$L(f) = 0$$.
        
        Consider now the partition $$P_n = \left\{ \cdots, \frac{kb}n, \cdots
        \right\}$$. We have, by density of the rationals and the definition of $$f$$ that
        
        $$
        U(f, P_n) = \sum_{k=1}^n {\frac{kb}{n}\left( \frac bn \right)} = \frac {b^2}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n k = \frac{b^2 n(n+1)}{2n^2}
        $$
        
        So, $$\lim_{n\to\infty} U(f, P_n) = \frac {b^2}{2}$$, and as $$U(f)$$ is
        the infimum over all $$U(f, P)$$, we have proven that $$U(f) \le \frac {b^2}2$$.
        
        To prove the other inequality, let $$Q$$ be any partition of $$[0, b]$$. Observe that
        
        $$
        U(f, Q) \ge U(f, Q \cup P_n) \ge \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{(k-1)b}{n} \left( \frac bn \right) = \frac{b^2 (n-1)n}{2n^2}
        $$
        
        This inequality holds for all $$n$$, so $$U(f, Q) \ge \frac{b^2}2$$ for
        all partitions $$Q$$ of $$[0, b]$$. From this we notice that $$U(f) \ge
        \frac{b^2}2$$ as it is a *greatest* lower bound. Together now, we
        conclude that $$U(f) = \frac{b^2}2$$.
    
    2.  No, as in part (a) we have proved that $$U(f) \ne L(f)$$.
    
    </div>
    
2.  Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose that $$f^2$$ is integrable. Does
    it follow that $$f$$ is also integrable? If so, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **No**. Let $$f(x) = 1$$ for $$x \in \mathbb Q$$ and $$f(x) = -1$$ for
    irrational $$x$$. Then $$f^2$$ is integrable but $$f$$ is not by a
    calculation similar to Example 22.2.
    
    </div>
    
3.  (32.6) Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose there exist
    sequences $$(U_n)$$ and $$(L_n)$$ of upper and lower Darboux sums for $$f$$
    such that $$\lim(U_n - L_n) = 0$$. Show $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ and
    that $$\int_a^b f = \lim U_n = \lim L_n$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **Proof**. Notice first that the sequences $$U_n$$ and $$L_n$$ are defined
    by two sequences of partitions $$(P_n)$$ and $$(Q_n)$$ for which $$U_n =
    U(f, P_n)$$ and $$L_n = L(f, Q_n)$$. In particular, we have that $$U_n \ge
    L_n$$ as they are upper and lower Darboux sums.
    
    Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. Then there exists $$N$$ so that for $$n >
    N$$ we know that $$U_n - L_n < \epsilon$$. Notice that
    
    $$\epsilon > U_n - L_n = U(f, P_n) - L(f, Q_n) \ge U(f, P_n\cup Q_n) - L(f, P_n \cup Q_n)$$.
    
    Take any $$n > N$$ and let $$P = P_n \cup Q_n$$. We have just proved that
    $$P$$ is a partition for which $$U(f, P) - L(f, P) < \epsilon$$. In other
    words, we have proved that $$f$$ is integrable.
    
    Notice that $$L_n \le U(f) \le U_n$$ for all $$n$$, so $$0 \le U(f) - L_n
    \le U_n - L_n$$. In particular, when $$n > N$$, we see that $$U(f) - L_n \le
    U_n - L_n < \epsilon$$. So $$U(f) = \lim L_n$$; in particular, $$L_n$$
    converges. As $$\lim U_n - L_n = 0$$, we conclude furthermore that $$\lim
    L_n = \lim U_n = U(f) = \int_a^b f$$.

4.  (32.7) Let $$f$$ be integrable on $$[a, b]$$ and suppose $$g$$ is a function
    on $$[a,b]$$ so that $$g(x) = f(x)$$ except perhaps at finitely many $$x$$
    in $$[a, b]$$.
    
    Show that $$g$$ is integrable on $$[a, b]$$ and that 
    $$\int_a^b f = \int_a^b g$$.
    *Hint*: First reduce to the case where $$f(x) = 0$$ for all $$x$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **Proof**. Suppose $$f(x) = 0$$ and that $$g(x) = 0$$ at almost all of $$[a,
    b]$$, except for when $$x = c$$ we have $$g(x) = \gamma$$. Suppose first
    that $$\gamma > 0$$.
    
    Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. If $$c = a$$, consider the partition $$P = \{ a,
    a+\epsilon/(2\gamma), b \}$$. If $$c = b$$, consider the partition $$P =
    \{a, b-\epsilon/(2\gamma), b \}$$. Otherwise, consider the partition $$P =
    \{a, c-\epsilon/(4\gamma), c+\epsilon/(4\gamma)\}$$. In all cases, observe
    that $$L(f, P) = 0$$ and that $$ U(f, P) = \epsilon/2$$. In particular,
    
    $$
    U(f, P) - L(f, P) = \gamma \epsilon/(2\gamma) = \epsilon/2 < \epsilon,
    $$
    
    So $$g$$ is integrable and $$\int_a^b g = L(f) = 0 = \int_a^b f$$.
    
    Suppose instead now that $$\gamma < 0$$; but by considering the function
    $$-g$$, we have just proved that $$\int_a^b (-g) = 0$$, and we may use
    linearity of the integral to realize that $$\int_a^b f = 0 = - \int_a^b (-g)
    = \int_a^b -(-g) = \int_a^b g$$ in this case as well.
    
    Now let $$f$$ be any function integrable on $$[a, b]$$, and suppose that
    $$g(x) = f(x)$$ except at some point $$x = c$$. Considering the function
    $$(g - f)$$ which is 0 at all points except for $$x = c$$, realize that we
    have shown above that $$0 = \int_a^b (g-f)$$, and by linearity of the
    integral,
    
    $$\int_a^b f = \int_a^b (g-f) + \int_a^b f = \int_a^b (g-f)+f = \int_a^b g.$$
    
    We have now shown completely the case in which $$g$$ differs by integrable
    $$f$$ at precisely one point. But what about finitely many points? We may
    use induction! Suppose that $$g_k(x) = f(x)$$ at all but $$k$$ points $$x_1,
    \cdots x_k$$, and take as an inductive hypothesis that $$\int_a^b g_k =
    \int_a^b f$$. Then notice that if $$g_{k+1}(x) = f(x)$$ at all but the
    $$k+1$$ points $$x_1, \cdots, x_k, x_{k+1}$$ we have that $$g_{k+1}(x) =
    g_k(x)$$ actually at all but one point $$x_{k+1}$$. But we have shown above that
    
    $$\int_a^b g_{k+1} = \int_a^b g_k = \int_a^b f.$$
    
    So, we have proven the case for any finite number of differing points. $$\Box$$
