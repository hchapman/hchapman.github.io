1.  (32.2) Let the function $$f$$ be defined as,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}
    x\;\; & x \in \mathbb Q \\
    0\;\; & x \in \mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$
    
    1.  Compute the upper and lower Darboux integrals for $$f$$ on the interval $$[0,b]$$.
    
    *Hint*. Here's how you can show that $$U(f) \ge b^2/2$$: For any partition
    $$Q$$, if $$P_n = \{\cdots \frac{kb}n \cdots\}$$, explain why 
    
    $$
    U(f, Q \cup P_n) \ge \sum_{k=1}^{n}{ \frac{(k-1)b}{n} \left(\frac bn\right) }.
    $$
    
    2.  Is $$f$$ integrable on the interval $$[0, b]$$?
    
2.  Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose that $$f^2$$ is integrable. Does
    it follow that $$f$$ is also integrable? If so, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.
    
3.  (32.6) Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose there exist
    sequences $$(U_n)$$ and $$(L_n)$$ of upper and lower Darboux sums for $$f$$
    such that $$\lim(U_n - L_n) = 0$$. Show $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ and
    that $$\int_a^b f = \lim U_n = \lim L_n$$.

4.  (32.7) Let $$f$$ be integrable on $$[a, b]$$ and suppose $$g$$ is a function
    on $$[a,b]$$ so that $$g(x) = f(x)$$ except perhaps at finitely many $$x$$
    in $$[a, b]$$.
    
    Show that $$g$$ is integrable on $$[a, b]$$ and that 
    $$\int_a^b f = \int_a^b g$$.
    *Hint*: First reduce to the case where $$f(x) = 0$$ for all $$x$$.
