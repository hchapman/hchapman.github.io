1.  Diagonalize the following matrices:
    1. The matrix,
    
       $$
       C = \begin{pmatrix}
       -1 & -5 \\
       4 & 7
       \end{pmatrix}
       $$
       
    2. The matrix,
    
       $$
       B = \begin{pmatrix}
       1 & 1 & 1 \\
       1 & 1 & 1 \\
       1 & 1 & 1
       \end{pmatrix}
       $$

2.  Given the following information about the $$4 \times 4$$ real matrix $$A$$,
    answer whether: (I) $$A$$ diagonalizes, (II) $$A$$ does not diagonalize, or (III) there is not enough information to tell.
    
    1.  $$A$$ is invertible.
    
    2.  $$A$$ has 4 distinct real eigenvalues.
    
    3.  The two eigenspaces of $$A$$ are 3-dimensional and 1-dimensional.
    
    4.  $$A^{5} = 0$$.

3.  Show that the following matrix is orthogonal:

    $$
    M = \begin{pmatrix}
    \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 3} & \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 3} & -\tfrac{1}{\sqrt 3} \\
    \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2} & \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 2} & 0 \\
    \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 6} & \tfrac{1}{\sqrt 6} & \tfrac{\sqrt 2}{\sqrt 3}
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$

4.  A matrix $$Q$$ has characteristic polynomial $$p_Q(\lambda) = \lambda^3 -
    2\lambda^2 + \lambda + 5$$. 
    
    1. Calculate $$\det(Q)$$.
    
    2. $$Q$$ has exactly one real eigenvalue. Does $$Q$$ diagonalize over $$\mathbb C$$?
    
5.  A matrix $$R$$ has characteristic polynomial $$p_R(\lambda) = \lambda^2 - 7\lambda + 12$$.

    1.  Calculate $$\det(R)$$.
    
    2.  Calculate $${\rm tr}(R)$$.
