1.  The following augmented matrices correspond to a linear system which has
    already been reduced by Gaussian elimination.
    
    For each part, describe all of the solutions to the system described by the
    augmented matrix. (You may express your answer in any way that you feel
    comfortable (as $$n$$-tuples, vectors, variable assignments...), but if you
    use variable names, make sure to let me know what they mean).
    
    1.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 0 & 0 & -3 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 7
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$
        
    2.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 0 & 0  & -3 \\
        0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\
        0 & 0 & 0  & 0
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$
       
    3.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccccc|c}
        1 & -6 & 0 & 0 & 3 & -2 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 4 & 7 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 5 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0        
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$
        
    4.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 0 & 0  & -3 \\
        0 & 1 & -3 & 2 \\
        0 & 0 & 0  & 3
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$

2.  Put the following linear system into an augmented matrix, reduce it using
    Gaussian elimination, and express the solution.
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2a + 2b + 2c &= 0 \\
    -2a + 5b + 2c &= 1 \\
    8a + b + 4c &= -1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

3.  In each of the following parts, each asterisk $$*$$ corresponds to any real
    number (they might all be different). If possible, answer whether the system
    represented by the augmented matrix has **(I) no solutions**, **(II) one unique
    solution**, **(III) infinitely many solutions**, or that there is **(IV) not enough
    information** to tell.
    
    1.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & * & * & * \\
        0 & 1 & * & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & *
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$

    2.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & * & * & * \\
        0 & 1 & * & * \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & *
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$
        
    3.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & * & * & * \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & * \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$
        
    4.  &nbsp;
    
        $$
        \left(
        \begin{array}{ccc|c}
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & * & * & *
        \end{array}
        \right)
        $$

4.  Under what conditions on the real numbers $$a$$ and $$b$$ will the following
    linear system have **no solutions**, **one solution**, and **infinitely many
    solutions**?
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2x - 3y &= a \\
    4x - 6y &= b
    \end{aligned}
    $$

5.  
    1.  The equation for a parabola is $$ax^2 + bx + c = y$$. Plug each of the
        three points in $$xy$$-coordinates $$(0, 3)$$, $$(1,2)$$, and $$(2, 4)$$
        into the parabola equation one at a time to obtain a linear system of
        three equations.
       
    2.  How many solutions are there to your system of linear equations from
        part (a)? You may use what you know about parabolas to answer this question.
