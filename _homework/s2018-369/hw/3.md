1.  Find the following matrix product, being sure to show your work:

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    2  & 0 & -1 & 0  & 4 \\
    1  & 1 & 3  & 0  & 2 \\
    -1 & 2 & 0  & -1 & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 1 \\
    -1 & 1 \\
    0 & 3 \\
    2 & 4 \\
    1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    You are welcome to use a calculator or computer program to check your
    answer, but I strongly advise you to first compute the result by hand.
    Remember, you won't have a calculator on our upcoming test.
    
2.  Express the following system of linear equations as a matrix equation $$A\vec x = b$$. You
    do not have to solve the system.
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    2a + 2b + 2c - d &= 0 \\
    -2a + 5b + 2c + d&= 1 \\
    8a + b + 4c + 2d &= -1
    \end{aligned}
    $$

3.  This question has two parts.

    1.  Use Gauss-Jordan elimination to put the following matrix in **reduced row
        echelon form**.
    
        $$
        \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$
        
    2.  Use your answer to part (a) to find the inverse $$A^{-1}$$ of the matrix
    
        $$
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 1 & 2 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 1 
        \end{pmatrix}
        $$

4.  Find all values of $$t$$ that satisfy the equation,

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}2&2&t\end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1&2&0\\
    2&0&3\\
    0&3&1
    \end{pmatrix}
    \begin{pmatrix}2\\2\\t\end{pmatrix}
    = 0
    $$

5.  Use the **definition of a linear function** to explain whether the following
    functions are linear or not. Answers that don't use the definition cannot
    receive full credit.
    
    1.  &nbsp;$$f\left(\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}\right) = \begin{pmatrix}2x + y \\ y\end{pmatrix}$$
    
    2.  &nbsp;$$f\left(\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}\right) = \begin{pmatrix}x + y + z \\ y + \frac 2z\end{pmatrix}$$
