1.  The *rotation matrix* $$R_\theta$$ is a matrix whose multiplication rotates
    vectors in $$\mathbb R^2$$ by $$\theta$$ radians counterclockwise. $$R_\theta$$ has the formula,
    
    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\
    \sin \theta & \cos \theta
    \end{pmatrix}
    $$
    
    1.  Calculate the determinant of $$R_\theta$$. Does it depend on $$\theta$$?
    
    2.  *Without doing any Gaussian elimination or using the formula for
        inverses of $$2 \times 2$$ matrices*, find a concise formula for
        $$(R_\theta)^{-1}.$$ (Hint: Think about what $$R_\theta$$ does
        geometrically).
        
    3.  Find a non-identity matrix $$B \ne I$$ for which $$B^3 = BBB = I$$.

2.  If $$A$$ is an $$n \times n$$ symmetric matrix (that is, $$A^T = A$$), and
    $$B$$ is any $$n \times m$$ matrix, show that the following are symmetric:
    
    1.  &nbsp;$$B^TB$$
    
    2.  &nbsp;$$BB^T$$
    
    3.  &nbsp;$$B^TAB$$

3.  Find the following determinants:

    1.  $$\det \begin{pmatrix}2 & 3 & 7 & 0 \\ 0 & -3 & 1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -2\end{pmatrix}$$
    
    2.  $$\det \begin{pmatrix}1 & -4 & 1 \\ 0 & 3 & 1 \\ 2 & -8 & 2\end{pmatrix}$$

4.  

    1.  $$A$$ is an $$n \times n$$ matrix and $$\det(A) = 2$$, find
        $$\det(3A)$$. (Hint: First calculate $$\det(3I)$$, then use that $$\det(AB) = \det(A)\det(B)$$.)
    
    2.  Is $$\det$$ a linear function on matrices?

5.  

    1.  For an $$n \times n$$ matrix $$A = (a^i_j)$$ and a number $$\lambda$$, compare $$\tr(\lambda A)$$ and $$\lambda \tr(A)$$.
    
    2.  For a pair of $$n \times n$$ matrices $$A = (a^i_j)$$ and $$B = (b^i_j)$$, compare
        $$\tr(A+B)$$ and $$\tr(A) + \tr(B)$$.
        
    3.  Is $$\tr$$ a linear function on matrices?
