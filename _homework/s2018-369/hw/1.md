1.  For the following parts, answer whether the given tuple describes a solution
    to the system of linear equations. If it is **not** a solution, explain why!
    
    1.  For the system,
    
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        2x + y + 2z &= 3 \\
        3x + y - z &= 2
        \end{aligned}
        $$
        
        is $$(1, -1, 1)$$ a solution?
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > No. Plugging the point into the second equation yields $$3+1-1=2$$
        > which is false, since $$3 \ne 2$$.
        
    2.  For the system,
    
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        5x - y + z &= 7 \\
        3x + y - z &= 1
        \end{aligned}
        $$
    
        is $$(1, s-2, s)$$ a solution (for every real number $$s$$)?
        
        {:.solution .collapse}
        
        > Yes. Plugging the point into the first equation yields $$7=7$$ and the
        > second equation yields $$1=1$$, both of which are true.

2.  Rewrite the following system of equations as an augmented matrix. You do not
    actually have to solve the system.
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    5x - y + z + 6w &= 7 \\
    3x + 3y - 2z &= 1 \\
    y - z &= 0 \\
    x - y - z &= 0 \\
    y &= 3
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > $$
    > \begin{pmatrix}
    > 5 & -1 & 1 & 6 & 7 \\ 3 & 3 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\
    > 0 & 1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & -1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
    > 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 3
    > \end{pmatrix}
    > $$
    
3.  Draw a picture that describes a system of three linear equations that has **no** solution.

    > one](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+x%3D1,+y%3D1,+x-y%3D1).

4.  Find all solutions to the following system of linear equations:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    3x + y &= 1 \\
    x - y &= 2
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    {:.solution .collapse}
    
    > As an augmented matrix, the system reduces to:
    >
    > $$
    > \begin{pmatrix}
    > 1 & 0 & 3/4 \\
    > 0 & 1 & -5/4 \\
    > \end{pmatrix}
    > $$
    >
    > So, $$x = 3/4$$ and $$y = -5/4$$.

5.  For the following parts, answer whether the function described is **linear** or **not**.

    1.  &nbsp;$$f(x) = 3x + 1$$
    
    2.  &nbsp;$$f(x_1, x_2) = 3x_1 - 6x_2$$
    
    3.  &nbsp;$$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 3x_1 + x_3$$
    
    4.  &nbsp;$$f(x, y) = 3xy + x + y$$

    > Originally, we had to solve this using the form of a linear function. Now,
    > we can use the definition.
    >
    > 1.  No, as $$f(2) = 7 \ne 2f(1) = 2(4)=8$$.
    >
    > 2.  Yes, as $$f(a+b,c+d) = 3(a+b)-6(c+d) = (3a-6c)+(3b-6d) = f(a,c)+f(b,d)$$.
    >
    > 3.  Yes, as $$f(a+b,c+d,x+y) = 3(a+b)+(x+y) = (3a+x) + (3b+y) = f(a,c,x) + f(b,d,y)$$. 
    >
    > 4.  No, as $$f(2,2) = 16 \ne 2f(1,1) = 2(5) = 10$$.
