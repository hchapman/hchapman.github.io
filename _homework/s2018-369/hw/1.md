1.  For the following parts, answer whether the given tuple describes a solution
    to the system of linear equations. If it is **not** a solution, explain why!
    
    1.  For the system,
    
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        2x + y + 2z &= 3 \\
        3x + y - z &= 2
        \end{aligned}
        $$
        
        is $$(1, -1, 1)$$ a solution?
        
    2.  For the system,
    
        $$
        \begin{aligned}
        5x - y + z &= 7 \\
        3x + y - z &= 1
        \end{aligned}
        $$
    
        is $$(1, s-2, s)$$ a solution (for every real number $$s$$)?

2.  Rewrite the following system of equations as an augmented matrix. You do not
    actually have to solve the system.
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    5x - y + z + 6w &= 7 \\
    3x + 3y - 2z &= 1 \\
    y - z &= 0 \\
    x - y - z &= 0 \\
    y &= 3
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
3.  Draw a picture that describes a system of three linear equations that has **no** solution.

4.  Find all solutions to the following system of linear equations:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    3x + y &= 1 \\
    x - y &= 2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

5.  For the following parts, answer whether the function described is **linear** or **not**.

    1.  &nbsp;$$f(x) = 3x + 1$$
    
    2.  &nbsp;$$f(x_1, x_2) = 3x_1 - 6x_2$$
    
    3.  &nbsp;$$f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 3x_1 + x_3$$
    
    4.  &nbsp;$$f(x, y) = 3xy + x + y$$
