**Reading**: 
Read sections 20, 23, 24

**Exercises**:

1.  Let \\(f\\) be uniformly continuous on a **bounded** set \\(S\\). Prove that \\(f\\) is bounded (on the set \\(S\\)).

2.  Give an example of each of the following, or explain why one does not exist.

    1.  A function that is continuous on \\([a,b]\\) but not uniformly continuous.
    
    2.  A function that is continuous on \\((a,b)\\) but not bounded.
    
    3.  Two functions \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) so that neither \\(f\\) nor \\(g\\) is continuous at \\(x_0 = 1\\) but \\(fg\\) is.

3.  Show that \\(x = \cos x\\) for some \\(x \in [0, \pi]\\).

4.  Recall the definition of *open set* from homework 6.

    1.  If \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are open sets, prove that \\(A \cap B\\) and \\(A \cup B\\) are open.
    
    2.  Prove that if \\((A_i)\\) is a sequence of open sets then \\(B = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i = \\{ x : x \in A_i \textrm{ for some } i \in \mathbb N \\}\\) is also open.
    
    3.  Find a sequence of open sets \\((A_i)\\) for which the set \\(\bigcap_{i=1}^\infty A_i = \\{x : x \in A_i \textrm{ for all } i \in \mathbb N\\}\\) is not open.
