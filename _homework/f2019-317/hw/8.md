**Reading**: 
Read sections 25, 28, 29.

**Exercises**:

1.  Give an example of each of the following:

    1.  A function which is bounded on a set \\(S\\) but not uniformly continuous on \\(S\\).
    
    2.  A function \\(f\\) and a point \\(a\\) for which \\(\lim_{x \to
        a^{+}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x)\\) (and both limits exist).

    3.  A function \\(f\\) and a point \\(a\\) for which \\(\lim_{x \to
        a^{\mathbb Q}} f(x) \ne \lim_{x \to a^{\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q}} f(x)\\) (and both limits exist).
    
    4.  A nonzero power series \\(g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {a_n x^n}\\) that is defined for all \\(x \in \mathbb R\\).
    
2.  Answer each question with a "yes" or "no," and a brief (1 sentence) justification.

    1.  If \\(f\\) is continuous on the bounded set \\(S\\), is it uniformly continuous on \\(S\\)?
    
    2.  Is the interval \\([a, b]\\) an open set?
    
    3.  Is there is a power series that converges only on the interval \\([-1, 1)\\)?

3.  A real set \\(S\\) is **compact** if it contains all of its limit points. In
    other words, the set \\(S\\) is compact if, for all convergent sequences
    \\((x_n)\\) in \\(S\\), \\(\lim x_n \in S\\). Let \\(S\\) be any real, compact set.
    
    1.  Show that \\(S\\) is bounded.
    
    2.  Show that \\(\bar S = \mathbb R \setminus S\\) is open.
    
4.  Let \\(S \subset \mathbb R\\) be compact, and let \\(f\\) be a real-valued function that is continuous on
    \\(S\\). Show that \\(f\\) is uniformly continuous on \\(S\\).
    **Suggestion:** Follow the proof of Theorem 19.2 in the book.
