2.  This question is worth double points.
    1.  Prove that $$x^m$$ is a continuous function for any $$m \in \mathbb N$$.
    
    2.  Prove that every polynomial function $$\sum_{i=0}^n{a_i x^i}$$ is
        continuous.
        
    3.  A rational function \\(g\\) is a quotient of polynomials \\(p,q\\):
        \\(g(x) = p(x)/q(x)\\), whose domain is \\(\\{x \in \mathbb R : q(x) \ne
        0\\}\\). Prove that every rational function is continuous.

3.  
    1.  Let $$f(x) = 1$$ for rational numbers $$x$$ and $$f(x) = 0$$ for
        irrational numbers. Show that $$f$$ is discontinous at every $$x$$ in $$\mathbb R$$.
        
    2.  Recall the function $$f(x)$$ from part (a). Let $$g(x)$$ be the function
        with domain $$\mathbb Q$$ defined as $$g(x) = f(x)$$ for all $$x \in
        \mathbb Q$$. Show that $$g$$ is continuous on its domain.

    3.  Let $$h(x) = x$$ for rational numbers $$x$$ and $$h(x) = 0$$ for
        irrational numbers. Show that $$h$$ is continuous at $$0$$ and at no other point.

    1.  **Proof**. Consider $$q \in \mathbb Q$$, and let $$\alpha$$ be an
        irrational number. Then the sequence $$(q + \alpha/n)$$ is a sequence of
        irrational numbers converging to $$q$$. But the sequence $$(f(q +
        \alpha/n))$$ converges to 0 even though $$f(q) = 1$$. Hence $$f$$ is not
        continuous at $$q$$.
        
        Now, consider $$\alpha$$ any irrational number. By density of the
        rationals, there exists a rational number $$q_n$$ for which $$\alpha -
        1/n < q_n < \alpha$$. Observe that $$q_n$$ converges to $$\alpha$$, and
        that $$(f(q_n))$$ converges to 1 while $$f(\alpha) = 0$$. Hence $$f$$ is
        not continuous at $$\alpha$$. $$\Box$$
        
    2.  Now that the domain is simply \\(\mathbb Q\\), we only consider rational
        sequences \\((q_n)\\) converging to a rational number \\(q\\). Of
        course, for all rational numbers \\(g(q_n) = 1\\) and so \\(\lim g(q_n)
        = \lim 1 = 1 = g(q)\\). So \\(g\\) is actually continuous on its domain.
    
    3.  **Proof**. Much of the reasoning in (a) holds, with minor changes. The
        meaningful thing to see here is why $$h$$ is continuous at $$0$$.
        
        Let $$(x_n)$$ be any sequence of real numbers converging to 0. If only
        finitely many of $$x_n$$ are irrational, it is easy to see that
        $$(h(x_n))$$ converges to 0, as all $$h(x_n)$$ are identically 0 for
        large $$n$$.
        
        Suppose there are an infinite number of rational $$x_n$$ and let these
        define the sequence $$(x_{n_k})$$. Observe both that $$\lim h(x_{n_k}) =
        \lim x_{n_k} = 0$$ and $$\limsup h(x_n) \le \limsup h(x_{n_k}) = 0$$ and
        that $$\liminf h(x_n) \ge \liminf h(x_{n_k}) = 0$$. So $$\lim h(x_n) = 0
        = h(0)$$, and we conclude that $$h$$ is continuous at 0. $$\Box$$

4.  Let $$E \subseteq \mathbb R$$ be a set of real numbers. An element $$s_0 \in
    E$$ is *interior* to $$E$$ if for some $$r > 0$$ we have
    
    $$
    \{ s \in \mathbb R : |s - s_0| < r\} = (s_0 - r, s_0 + r) \subset E.
    $$
    
    The set $$E$$ is *open in $$\mathbb R$$* if every point in $$E$$ is interior
    to $$E$$.
    
    Let $$f: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R$$ be a function, and for any subset $$V
    \subset \mathbb R$$, let $$f^{-1}(V) \subset \mathbb R$$ be the set;
    
    $$
    f^{-1}(V) = \{ x \in \mathbb R : f(x) \in V \}.
    $$
    
    Show that $$f$$ is continuous if and only if, for every open
    set $$U \subset \mathbb R$$, $$f^{-1}(U)$$ is also an open set.

    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
     
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **Proof**. ($$\Rightarrow$$) Suppose $$f$$ is continuous and let $$U$$ be
    any open set in $$\mathbb R$$ (viewed as the range of $$f$$!) Let $$x \in
    f^{-1}(U)$$. Notice that as $$f(x) \in U$$, and $$U$$ is open, there is some
    $$\epsilon > 0$$ for which, for any $$y \in \mathbb R$$, $$|y - f(x)| <
    \epsilon$$ implies that $$y \in U$$. 
    
    Now, as $$f$$ is continuous, there
    exists a number $$\delta > 0$$ so that whenever $$t \in \mathbb R$$ and
    $$|t - x| < \delta$$, $$|f(t) - f(x)| < \epsilon$$; in other words, $$f(t)
    \in U$$! So $$t \in f^{-1}(U)$$.
    
    We have just shown that for all $$x \in f^{-1}(U)$$ there exists $$\delta >
    0$$ so that $$|t - x| < \delta$$ implies that $$t \in f^{-1}(U)$$. That is,
    we have just shown that $$f^{-1}(U)$$ is open, as desired.
    
    ($$\Leftarrow$$) Suppose that for all open sets $$U \subseteq \mathbb R$$,
    we know that $$f^{-1}(U)$$ is open.
    
    Observe that any open interval $$(a,b)$$ is an open set. (Let $$x \in
    (a,b)$$ and observe that $$r = \min{|x-a|, |x-b|}) > 0$$ satisfies the
    correct condition)
    
    Let $$\epsilon > 0$$, let $$x \in \mathbb R$$ (the domain of $$f$$!) and
    consider the open interval $$I = (f(x) - \epsilon, f(x) + \epsilon) = \{y \in \mathbb R : |f(x) - y| < \epsilon\}$$ which is
    an open set in the range of $$f$$.
    
    We have that $$f^{-1}(I)$$ is itself open by assumption. In other words,
    there exists $$\delta > 0$$ so that for any $$x \in f^{-1}(I)$$, if $$t \in
    \mathbb R$$ and $$|t - x| < \delta$$, $$t \in f^{-1}(I)$$. So in fact,
    $$f(t) \in I$$, meaning that $$|f(t) - f(x)| < \epsilon$$.
    
    Hence $$f$$ is continuous by the $$\epsilon,\delta$$ definition of continuity. $$\Box$$
