You are welcome to use any result of Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 in the book if you find
them helpful.

1.  Prove that $$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = (1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n)^2$$.
    
2.  Guess a formula for the sum $$1 + 3 + \cdots + (2n - 1)$$ (try evaluating
    for $$n = 1,2,3,4$$ and look for patterns). Then prove that your formula is
    correct.

3.  For each subset of $$\mathbb R$$ below, determine both the
    **maximum** and the **minimum**, if they exist. If either doesn't exist,
    say so. You do not need to give a rigorous proof of your answer.
    
    1.  $$A = \{ 3, 5, 1, 4 \}$$
    
    2.  $$B = \left\{\dfrac {(-1)^n}n \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    3.  $$C = \left\{\cos\left(\dfrac{n\pi}{3}\right) \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    4.  $$D = \{ r \;:\; r \in \mathbb Q,\; r^2 < 5 \}$$
    
    5.  $$E = \left\{ 1 - \dfrac{1}{2^n} \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
4.  Don't worry about writing out any formal proofs in this problem. Decide
    whether each of the following statements is true. If the statement is **true**,
    you don't need to do anything more. If the statement is **false**, give a
    concrete example (that is, a counterexample) that shows the statement
    failing.
    
    1.  An **irrational** number is an element of $$\mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q$$. If $$r \ne 0$$ is rational and $$\alpha$$ is irrational, then
        $$r + \alpha$$ is irrational.
        
    2.  $$\vert \vert a \vert - \vert b \vert \vert \le \vert a - b \vert$$ for all $$a, b \in \mathbb R$$.
        
    3.  A nonempty finite set always has a maximum.
    
    
5.  Let $$A$$ be a nonempty set of real numbers which has a minimum. Let
    $$-A$$ be the set $$\{ -x \;:\; x \in A \}$$. Prove that
    
    $$
    \min A = -\max(-A).
    $$
