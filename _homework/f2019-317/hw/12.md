**Note**:

This homework assignment is just an example, for practice with our
end-of-semester material. It will not be collected or graded.

**Exercises**:

1.  Let $$f$$ be integrable on $$[a,b]$$. Prove that, for any subset $$S
    \subseteq [a, b]$$ we have
    
    $$
    M(|f|, S) - m(|f|, S) \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)
    $$
    
    *Hint*. For $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$, we have $$\vert f(x_0)\vert - \vert f(y_0)\vert \le \vert f(x_0) -
    f(y_0)\vert \le M(f, S) - m(f, S)$$.
    
    **Note**: This is the primary step in proving that \\(|f|\\) is integrable
    whenever \\(f\\) is.

    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. The first part of the hint follows from the triangle inequality, as
    
    $$
    \vert f(x_0)\vert = \vert f(x_0) - f(y_0) + f(y_0) \vert \le \vert
    f(x_0) - f(y_0) \vert + \vert f(y_0) \vert.
    $$
    
    The second part of the hint comes from how $$M(f, S) \ge f(x_0)$$ and $$m(f,
    S) \le f(y_0)$$ for all $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$.
    
    On the other hand, we have that for any $$\epsilon > 0$$, properties of the
    supremum and infimum guarantee that there exists $$x_0, y_0 \in S$$ so that,
    
    $$
    M(\vert f\vert, S) < \vert f(x_0)\vert + \epsilon/2 \quad\textrm{and}
    \quad m(\vert f\vert, S) > \vert f(y_0) \vert - \epsilon/2.
    $$
    
    So we have that,
    
    $$
    M(\vert f\vert, S) - m(\vert f\vert, S) < \vert f(x_0)\vert - \vert f(y_0) \vert
    + \epsilon \le M(f, S) - m(f, S) + \epsilon.
    $$
    
    This holds for all $$\epsilon > 0$$, so we conclude that the desired
    inequality holds. $$\Box$$

2.  Show that $$\left\vert \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \sin^8(e^x)\; dx \right\vert \le \frac{16\pi^3}{3}$$.

    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    **Proof**. Using Theorems 33.4 and 33.5, together with the FTC I (for
    example), we have that (as $$\left\vert \sin^8(e^x )\right\vert \le 1$$)
    
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    \left\vert \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \sin^8(e^x)\; dx \right\vert
    &\le  \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} \left\vert x^2 \sin^8(e^x) \right\vert\; dx \\
    &\le \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} \left\vert x^2 \right\vert\; dx = \int_{-2\pi}^{2\pi} x^2 \; dx \\
    &\le \frac{16\pi^3}3. \Box
    \end{align*}
    $$

3.  Let $$f$$ be the function,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}\sin(\frac 1x) & x \ne 0\\0 & x=0\end{array}\right.
    $$
    
    Prove that $$f$$ is integrable on $$[-1, 1]$$. *Hint*. See Excercise
    33.11(c) and its solution in the textbook. (Why can we not apply the
    Dominated Convergence Theorem to prove that $$f$$ is integrable?)
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">
    
    **Proof**. Let $$\epsilon > 0$$. Notice that $$f$$ is continuous on each of
    $$[-1, -\epsilon/8]$$ and $$[\epsilon/8, 1]$$, and is hence integrable. This
    means that there exist partitions $$Q_1$$ of $$[-1, -\epsilon/8]$$ and
    $$Q_2$$ of $$[\epsilon/8, 1]$$ so that
    
    $$
    U(f, Q_1) - L(f, Q_1) < \epsilon/4 \quad\text{and}\quad
    U(f, Q_2) - L(f, Q_2) < \epsilon/4.
    $$
    
    Notice that $$P = Q_1 \cup Q_2$$ is a partition of $$[-1, 1]$$ and
    furthermore that
    
    $$
    U(f, P) = U(f, Q_1) + \epsilon/4 + U(f, Q_2)
    $$
    
    and,
    
    $$
    L(f, P) = L(f, Q_1) - \epsilon/4 + L(f, Q_2).
    $$
    
    (Why? The only terms in the two sums are those contributed by the interval
    $$[-\epsilon/8, \epsilon/8]$$ but we know that the supremum and infimum of
    $$f$$ on any such interval are $$1$$ and $$-1$$ respectively and that the
    width of this interval is $$\epsilon/4$$) So,
    
    $$
    \begin{align*}
    U(f, P) - L(f, P)
    &= (U(f, Q_1) + \epsilon/4 + U(f, Q_2)) - (L(f, Q_1) - \epsilon/4 + L(f, Q_2)) \\
    &= (U(f, Q_1) - L(f, Q_1)) + (U(f, Q_2) - L(f, Q_2)) + \epsilon/2 \\
    &< \epsilon/4 + \epsilon/4 + \epsilon/2 = \epsilon.
    \end{align*}
    $$
    
    We can find any such $$P$$ for any $$\epsilon > 0$$, so we conclude that
    $$f$$ is integrable on $$[-1, 1]$$.

4.  Let $$f$$ be a continuous function on $$\mathbb R$$ and define

    $$
    F(x) = \int_0^{\sin x}{f(t)\; dt}\quad\textrm{for } x \in \mathbb R.
    $$
    
    Show that $$F$$ is differentiable on $$\mathbb R$$ and compute $$F'$$.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    Let $$G(x) = \int_0^x{f(t)\; dt}$$. Then $$G(x)$$ is differentiable and
    $$G'(x) = f(x)$$ by the FTC II as $$f$$ is continuous. Notice that $$F(x) =
    G(\sin x)$$. So by the chain rule, $$F$$ is differentiable and $$F'(x) =
    G'(\sin x)\cos x = f(\sin x)\cos x$$.

    </div>

5.  Let $$f$$ be the function,

    $$
    f(t) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
    t & t < 0\\
    t^2+1 & 0 \le t \le 2\\
    0 & t > 2 \end
    {array}\right.
    $$
    
    1.  Determine the function $$F(x) = \int_0^x f(t)\; dt$$.
    
    2.  Sketch $$F$$. Where is $$F$$ continuous?
    
    3.  Where is $$F$$ differentiable? Calculate $$F'$$ at the points of differentiability.
    
    {::options parse_block_html="true" /}
    
    <div class="solution collapse">

    1.  $$
        F(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
        t^2 & t < 0\\
        t^3/3+t & 0 \le t \le 2\\
        14/3 & t > 2 \end
        {array}\right.
        $$
        
    2.  By the FTC II, $$F(x)$$ is continuous everywhere.
    
    3.  By the FTC II, $$F(x)$$ is differentiable everywhere that $$f(x)$$ is
        continuous, hence at all $$x$$ except possibly $$x=0$$ and $$x=2$$.
        
        We can prove that $$F(x)$$ is not differentiable at $$x=0$$ and $$x=2$$
        by showing that the left-hand and right-hand difference quotient limits
        disagree.
