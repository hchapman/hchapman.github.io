1.  For each subset of $$\mathbb R$$ below, determine both the
    **supremum** and the **infimum**. You do not need to give a rigorous proof of your answer.
    
    1.  $$A = \{ 3, 5, 1, 4 \}$$
    
    2.  $$B = \left\{\dfrac {(-1)^n}n \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    3.  $$C = \left\{\cos\left(\dfrac{n\pi}{3}\right) \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$
    
    4.  $$D = \{ r \;:\; r \in \mathbb Q,\; r^2 < 5 \}$$
    
    5.  $$E = \left\{ 1 - \dfrac{1}{2^n} \;:\; n \in \mathbb N \right\}$$


2.  Let $$A$$ be a nonempty, bounded set of real numbers. Let
    $$-A$$ be the set $$\{ -x \;:\; x \in A \}$$. Prove that
    
    $$
    \sup A = -\inf(-A).
    $$

3.  Give examples of;

    1.  A sequence of irrational numbers converging to a rational number
    
    2.  A sequence of rational numbers converging to an irrational number

4.  For each of the following sequences, determine its limit (usual Calculus
    reasoning will be helpful here), then prove that the sequence does indeed
    converge to this limit.

    1.  $$a_n = \frac {2n-3}{3n+4}$$
   
    2.  $$s_n = \frac {\cos n}{n}$$

5.  Let $$(s_n)$$ be a sequence in $$\mathbb R$$. 

    1.  Prove that $$\lim{s_n} = 0$$ if and only if 
        $$\lim{ s_n^2 } = 0$$. (Hint:
        This is an "if and only if" statement, so you will need to prove both
        directions of the statement.)

    2.  Prove that if $$s_n = (-1)^n$$ that 
        $$\lim{s_n^2}$$ exists but $$s_n$$ diverges.
