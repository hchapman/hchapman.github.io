**Reading**: 
1.  If you haven't yet, skim sections 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7.

2.  Read sections 5, **8**, and 9. (Section 8 is about writing good proofs!)
^

**Exercises**:

1.  Suppose \\(\lim a_n = a\\) and \\(\lim b_n = b\\). Find 
    \\[ \lim \frac{a_n^3 + 4a_n}{b_n^2 + 1} \\]
    and prove that your limit is correct. For this problem, be explicit about which limit theorems you are using for full credit.

2.  Suppose \\((s_n)\\) is a sequence and \\(0 < s_n < \sqrt{\frac{2}{n-1}} \\) for all \\(n\\). Prove that
    \\[ \lim s_n = 0. \\]

3.  For each of the following false statements, give a counterexample.

    1.  If the sequence $$s_n$$ converges and the sequence $$t_n$$ diverges, the product $$s_nt_n$$ also diverges.

    2.  If $$s_n$$ and $$t_n$$ are two divergent sequences, their sum $$s_n + t_n$$ also diverges.
   
    3.  If a sequence $$s_n$$ converges, so too does the sequence $$t_n = \sum_{i=1}^n{s_i}$$.
   
4.  Show that if \\(\lim s_n = +\infty\\) and \\(\lim t_n > -\infty\\), then \\(\lim(s_n + t_n) = +\infty\\).
    
5.  Use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to show that the sequence \\((s_n)\\)
    defined by \\(s_1 = 1\\) and \\(s_{n+1} = \sqrt{s_n + 2}\\) converges.
