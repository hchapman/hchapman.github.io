**Reading**: 
Read sections (30,) 31, 32

**Exercises**:

1.  Let $$f(x) = x^2$$ when $$x$$ is rational and $$f(x) = 0$$ otherwise.

    1.  Show that $$f$$ is continuous at $$0$$.
    
    2.  Show that $$f$$ is discontinuous at all $$x \ne 0$$.
    
    3.  Prove that $$f$$ is differentiable at $$0$$. (It is insufficient to
        simply claim $$f'(x) = 2x$$)

2.  Suppose $$f$$ is differentiable at $$a$$.

    1.  Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} = f'(a)$$.
    
    2.  Prove that $$\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a-h)}{2h} = f'(a)$$.

3.  Let \\(f(x) = x \sin \frac 1x\\) for \\(x \ne 0\\) and \\(f(x) = 0\\) for
    \\(x = 0\\). Note that \\(f\\) is continuous on \\(\mathbb R\\) (in fact, it
    is uniformly continuous on \\([-R, R]\\) for any \\(R \ge 0\\)).
    
    Prove that \\(f(x)\\) is not differentiable at \\(x = 0\\).
