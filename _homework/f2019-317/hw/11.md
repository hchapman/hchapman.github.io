**Reading**:

Read Section 34.

**Exercises**:

1.  Let the function $$f$$ be defined as,

    $$
    f(x) = \left\{ 
    \begin{array}{ll}
    x\;\; & x \in \mathbb Q \\
    0\;\; & x \in \mathbb R \setminus \mathbb Q
    \end{array}
    \right.
    $$
    
    1.  Compute the upper and lower Darboux integrals for $$f$$ on the interval $$[0,b]$$.
    
        *Hint*. Here's how you can show that $$U(f) \ge b^2/2$$: For any partition
        $$Q$$, if $$P_n = \{\cdots \frac{kb}n \cdots\}$$, explain why 
        
        $$
        U(f, Q \cup P_n) \ge \sum_{k=1}^{n}{ \frac{(k-1)b}{n} \left(\frac bn\right) }.
        $$
    
    2.  Is $$f$$ integrable on the interval $$[0, b]$$?

2.  Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose that $$f^2$$ is integrable. Does
    it follow that $$f$$ is also integrable? If so, prove it. If not, provide a counterexample.

3.  Let $$f$$ be a bounded function on $$[a, b]$$. Suppose there exist
    sequences $$(U_n)$$ and $$(L_n)$$ of upper and lower Darboux sums for $$f$$
    such that $$\lim(U_n - L_n) = 0$$. Show $$f$$ is integrable on $$[a,b]$$ and
    that $$\int_a^b f = \lim U_n = \lim L_n$$.
