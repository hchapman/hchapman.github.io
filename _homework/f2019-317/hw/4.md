**Reading**: 
Read sections 10, 11, 12.

**Exercises**:

1.  Come up with an example for each of the following, or explain why they cannot exist.

    1.  A decreasing, divergent sequence.
    
    2.  An unbounded, convergent sequence.
    
    3.  An increasing Cauchy sequence.
    
    4.  A sequence with undefined \\(\liminf\\).
    
    5.  A sequence whose subsequences all converge.

2.  For each of the following sequences, find the $$\liminf$$ and the
    $$\limsup$$.
   
    1. $$a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}$$
   
    2. $$b_n = n \cos \left( \frac {n\pi}{5} \right)$$
   
    3. $$c_n = (-1)^n - \frac 1n$$
    
3.  Let $$(s_n)$$, $$(t_n)$$ be sequences. Suppose there exists \\(N_0\\) so that \\(s_n \le t_n\\) for all \\(n > N_0\\). Prove that if both \\((s_n), (t_n)\\) converge, then \\(\lim {s_n} \le \lim {t_n}\\).
    
4.  Prove that $$\liminf s_n = -\limsup(-s_n)$$ for any sequence $$s_n$$.

5.  Let $$(s_n)$$ be an increasing sequence of positive numbers. Let
    $$(\sigma_n)$$ be defined by,
   
    $$
    \sigma_n = \frac{s_1 + s_2 + \cdots + s_n}{n}.
    $$

    Prove that $$(\sigma_n)$$ is in increasing sequence. (The $$\sigma_n$$ are called
    *Cesaro means*)
